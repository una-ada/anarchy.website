When I left off last time I was ready to double down on a map that I definitely
was not happy with. Attempting to find some resources on texturing a map I came
across [a post about using Google Earth imagery][1]. Now, this was really
interesting, but it just felt like it would be a huge waste given the state of
my maps right now. So, back to Wilbur I go.

One thing _ma_ definitely needs right now is islands. I was looking at some
island arcs (which ended up dragging me into a [huge tangent][2]), and I think
I need to focus on building out from a volcano point with eroded land. To that
end I painted in some islands, raised the land, eroded, lowered back down, a
whole bunch. I also upscaled the image so now it's way too big (~20MB for the
texture). Obviously I still have to share it here, so I popped it open in
Photoshop and just compressed it down a bit for your viewing pleasure:

Ok. Fuck this. I'm not happy with it at all. Fresh start, I need something that
feels better from the ground up. There needs to be volcanoes and glaciers and
maybe even some asteroids. I'm going for a world here not a field of rivers. To
do this I'll need a new map generator. First one I come across is Experilous:
[Map Generator][4], which is really nice, it has tectonics and climate but it
doesn't seem to output a usable heightmap. Here is the output I get from it:

![Experilous Generator][5]

**FIGURE 9.** Map generated using [experilous.com/...][4].

Further searching, I found [Tectonics.js][6] by [davidson16807][7], which has a
greater capability when it comes to heightmaps but still lacks in detail (esp.
with regards to the ocean floor). Here's what its output looks like:

![Tectonics.js Generator][8]

**FIGURE 10.** Map generated using [Tectonics.js][6].

Back to searching, I saw someone recommend a program called "Platec" but I can't
find a download for Windows. To that end, I found a fork of it creatively called
[plate-tectonics][9]. The issue with this one is that it's in 2D, so it wraps on
the $y$-axis ðŸ˜Ÿ. I'll move forward with it, but understand I have little
confidence. It's implemented into a larger program by the same author,
[Mindwerks][10]: [worldengine][11], so I'll run it through that.

This takes quite a bit to simulate all the tectonics and erosion so while I wait
for that I ran Fig.10 through Wilbur a bit, which created this fairly
interesting concoction:

![Tectonics.js + Wilbur][12]

**FIGURE 11.** Figure 10 eroded with Wilbur.

This isn't that bad to be honest, it's still just missing a lot of ocean details
that kind of make the tectonics simulation route worthwhile. I, of course,
forgot that the worldengine default is $512\times512$ so I had to redo it using
the command

```
worldengine world -gs -q 50 -x 2048 -y 1024
```

For the list of options here [read the docs][13]. Larger files mean ever larger
waiting times, so I'm just sitting here watching [Neo Yokio][14] again. So, I
tried to get a grayscale heightmap, but evidently that didn't work. Regardless
of that, here's a biome map that it produced which I think looks neat:

![worldengine biome map][15]

**FIGURE 12.** Biome map produced by worldengine.

It looks a bit too island-y for my taste, but it's better to have islands and
not need them than to not have islands an need them. Next step is, once again to
pass this through Wilbur and see what we can do.

This needs a lot of work on the oceans still, but I forgot to output this plates
so I'm going to try to generate them using the command

```
worldengine plates -gs -q 50 -x 2048 -y 1024 -s 56756
```

and praying to the RNG gods that this will result in the same end state. After
waiting for who knows how long, I was blessed with this beautiful image:

Using this as a guideline, I went through and used the paintbrush with the
maximum filter set to some arbitrary value and drew in my continental shelves.
Gave this the typical treatment: raise above sea level, add noise, fill basins,
precipiton-based erosion, incise flow, lower back down, etc. Running through
that in cycles, mixing it up and whatnot, eventually ending up with this:
