## Preface

Lately, I've been trying to be more active again. _Trying_. So, to that end,
I've registered for a few "hackathon" events. One of which is hosted by
[Mintbean][1]: [Hiring Hackathon for Jr. Web Devs][2], which I was very excited
about... at first. There's nothing wrong with the event itself, but I was
required to show up to another event for the first two days of this week long
hackathon (might write up a sort of post-op for that one too at some point).
That's all to say, I'm a bit nerfed as it were here. It's now Saturday and the
submission deadline is Tuesday morning![^2] I'm only now starting!
{:.content__p_dropcap}

[^2]:
    I just got a notification in the Discord server this morning that the
    deadline is approaching so we should be putting the final touches on our
    projects now, with a little deployment checklist... oof.

What do I need to be doing then? Well, the prompt for the challenge is rather
simple: build a digital art application. This can be either front-end only or
fullstack... I'm obviously going to be doing the latter, why wouldn't I?[^1]
We're given two user stories:

[^1]: Because of the time constraints? Dumbass.[^3]
[^3]:
    This isn't even future Una talking here, this is me now acknowledging this
    is a stupid idea!

1. As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
2. As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a
   color, texture or pattern.

Additionally, for the fullstack component, we're given a few ideas: shareable
art, saveable files, and user profiles with galleries of art.
{:.content__p_noindent}

See? Pretty simple! Well, making a drawing app is somewhat complicated in
general, plus this will need to be deployed, so there's a good amount of work
that needs to be done, overall. Needless to say, I'm speedrunning this, lol.

## I. _Concept_
{:#i}

This would be the hardest part if I hadn't been thinking about it all week:
deciding what it is _I_ am going to do for this. I'm going to keep it pretty
simple, sure, but I want extendability. The option to expand on projects is very
important to me, you see. To that end, I'm going to try to make a drawing
library that can be built up on, implementing a lot of basics and a lot of
modularity.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

The user stories imply at least a "brush" and a "paint bucket" tool. Of course,
that paint bucket is a sort of "and/or" in that part of the provided examples
was a sort of coloring book type tool. For more on that, see [Free Coloring
Pages][3] which is listed under a section titled "Advanced applications, for
further inspiration. We DO NOT recommend you build these..." in the event docs.

### I-1. Inspiration
{:#i-1}

I suppose my main inspiration here is actually [DrawTwit][4].[^4] This was a
small drawing application Pixiv built in collaboration with Twitter back
in 2009. Or, maybe, it's successor [pixiv Sketch][5]. Taking a quick look at the
app, we see a fairly simply UI:

[^4]:
    It's dead now, this page will take you to an announcement page and then
    redirect you to pixiv Sketch.

I like the brushes, and their accompanying options (size and opacity), but
something like smudge seems a bit beyond my capabilities at the moment. So I'm
thinking I'll stick with the brushes, paint bucket, color picker, history, and
layers... for now.
{:content__p_noindent}

### I-2. Research
{:#i-2}

Going to go over some ideas, like, really quick here! The most basic "drawing
app" would be something akin to this [HTML5 Drawing Pad][7] by CodePen user
[@HayyGateaux][8]. This uses a single, simple canvas with mouse inputs
controlling points on a stroked line. Easy, realistic, but not extensible.

Having an input history would require each stroke to be held in memory, each
state of the canvas to be saved. This can get pretty large, so how am I going to
handle that if I don't want the canvas to just be very small?

I recall a classmate of mine, [Aakaash Meduri][9], doing [a project][10] with
drawing tools that would animate the strokes the user had input. [The
canvas][11] in that project used a React component called
[react-canvas-draw][12], which saves the drawing data already... this is very
neat but not very helpful in this instance, sadly. I can still get something out
of it, by picking the library apart, I just can't _use_ the library.

Hmm, reading through this all, it just seems to be that it also uses a line
input like the previous example, but it saves those lines in an array... ok.
Yeahhhh... that's not going to help...
{:.content__p_noindent}

I have a general idea here, that is to not use a line history. It should
probably be something like a diff? Y'know, like how git commits just give you
_what changed_ rather than the state of the project as a whole? That kind of
thing, there's probably some info online for how to do this!

Looking into concepts like this online, I'm getting some basic info. For
instance, [this answer on SO][13] touches on invertible functions. Essentially,
if the operation merely needs to have the inverse applied, then you just need to
store what that function is; for instance: inverting colors is undone by
inverting colors. Of course, this sort of thing isn't necessarily in the scope
of this project as it stands, but keeping the possibility open is important!
Another [answer][14] points to a quote from a [page about GIMP][15]:
{:.content__p_noindent}

I don't know how this is supposed to be useful, tho, it just reiterates
previously mentioned information! [Other answers][16] pertaining more to brush
strokes return to the issue of using canvas lines, essentially. I don't like
this because it severely limits what you can do with brushes! I want the canvas
to be pixel editing not vectors... I think I have an idea here.
{:.content__p_noindent}

It might be complicated to implement, but basically as long as you're inputing a
brush stroke, you're doing so on a sort of temporary layer. This layer when
"completed" will have it's inversion calculated based on what's below it. If
you're cover up sections, you're masking them in a sense, so undo would have to
store the images that was masked. This could theoretically lower the amount of
stored data, since a brush stroke isn't necessarily going to cover the entire
canvas! Combining this with the aforementioned concept of inverting filters,
there simply needs to be a way to define a filter that inverts the brush stroke.

I'm only concerning myself with this at the moment because it _could_ dictate
the way that data is stored and generated in the first place. However, given
everything said here, I think I have the general idea now.
{:.content__p_noindent}

## II. _Design_

I was really tempted to start out by doing a logo for this. I've been meaning to
name all my projects in alphabetical order, but given the recent acquisition of
the domain name 猫.dev, I couldn't help but call this "描.猫!" Of course, I
thought I could throw together something really cute and simple in a few
minutes... I was very wrong about this. I spent a few hours, which I do not
have, messing around in Illustrator to no avail. I will revisit this in the
future.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

For now, the priority should be the wireframes!
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-1. Sketches

Ok, so this is going to be really basic. I don't have a lot of motivation to be
super original with the wireframes. The UI for the editor is just going to be
something akin to Pixiv Sketch, with a bit of influence from Photoshop or MS
Paint for the color selector, rather than just a list of preselected colors like
Sketch has.

When it comes to posts and profiles, it's mostly something like Instagram. I
thought it might be neat to do a masonry layout to accomodate different sizes of
artwork, being columns so that the design can be very responsive... haven't
quite accomodated that in the design in the editor... hmm.

| _User Profile_ ![][21] |                     |

This is all the sketches I did. It's pretty basic, as I said. Also, this is all
I got done over the weekend, so I do not have time to clean these up in Adobe
XD! In fact, I probably should just cut the scope of this down to the editor for
now... come back to it when I have more time, perhaps.
