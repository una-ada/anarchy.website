  In this episode of Chloe & Una's Tentacular Experience, our brave hentai 
  researchers delve into an ancient relic of the distant past (circa
  2000-2012), Kafun Shoujo by Koume Keito. What if we lived in a world where 
  plant pollen was actually anthropomorphized into people who wanted to have 
  sex with everyone constantly? What if stock exchanges also featured 
  anthropomorphized stock girls that one could have sex with? What do 
  schoolgirls have in common with Joseph Stalin? And what would a breakcore 
  remix of a hentai review podcast sound like? All these mind-boggling 
  questions and more are answered in volume 3 of Chloe & Una's Tentacular 
  Experience.

Hello everyone! I’m Una... and I’m Chloe...and welcome to the third installment
of Chloe and Una’s Tentacular Experience, a weekly podcast that hasn’t published
an episode in 343 days! I mean, uh, a weekly podcast bringing you the hottest
hentai reviews for your slutty slutty ears. Today we’re going to talk about
_Kafun Shoujo_, or, "The Pollinic Girls Attack!" As usual, anytime one of us
discovers a new fetish we will be playing this sound.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

## I. _Background_
{:#i}

"The Pollinic Girls Attack!" (<ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>花粉</rb><rb>少女</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>Kafun</rt><rt>Shoujo</rt></rtc>
</ruby>) is a loosely connected anthropomorphic eromanga anthology by Koume 
Keito (小梅けいと) with an animated adaptation. Originally published in two 
volumes (2006 and 2010) before being republished as another two volumes in 
2017, and finally combined into a single volume called "The Pollinic Girls 
Attack! Complete" (花粉少女こんぷりーと) in 2019. This latest edition was 
licensed for English release by Fakku.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

While these anthologies contain a number of one-shots and multi-part stories,
the primary and titular theme revolves around anthropomorphized pollen.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Pink Pineapple licensed the series for an anime adaptation, releasing four 
volumes. The first two volumes were released in 2008 and the latter two in 2012.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Chloe's theory on the background: inspired by two bits, the realization that
pollen is essentially plant sex and what if humans also had the plant sex? And
that people about to cum look like they’re about to sneeze... also both end up
using up tissues.

Moving on to today's Japanese vocabulary lesson! This time we're focusing on
some common abbreviations!

"JK" is a colloquial abbreviation of the phrase <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>高生,</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>kousei</rt></rtc>
</ruby> meaning high school girl and technically already an abbreviation of
<ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>高校生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>koukousei</rt></rtc>
</ruby>. In the context of erotica, and this may consequently be the case 
elsewhere, the term instead abbreviates <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>校生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>kousei</rt></rtc>
</ruby>, more closely translating as "schoolgirl." Of course, this change may 
in some cases be a simple typo (or so the [Pixiv Dictionary claims](
  https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E6%A0%A1%E7%94%9F
)), but it is generally used to remove the implicit statement of age. A high school student is more than likely not over the age of 18, making their inclusion in erotica morally reprehensible, but a student in general could be any age. So, rather than attending some high school <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc>(高校)</rbc>
  <rtc>koukou</rtc>
</ruby>, characters in erotic works will instead attend some "academy," either 
<ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc>学園</rbc>
  <rtc>gakuen</rtc>
</ruby> or <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc>学院</rbc>
  <rtc>gakuin</rtc>
</ruby>.
{:.content__p_noindent}

A similar term exists for high school boys: <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>男子</rb><rb>校生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>danshi</rt><rt>kousei</rt></rtc>
</ruby> abbreviated
as "DK." Further abbreviations also exist for other levels of education in cases
where specifying that is desirable (hopefully not in erotica, though there are
\*sigh\* instances of that happening): "JC" for <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>中学生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>chuugakusei</rt></rtc>
</ruby>, "JS" for <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>小学生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>shougakusei</rt></rtc>
</ruby>, and the parallel DC and DS.
{:.content__p_noindent}

One could also abbreviate college students in this manner: <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>女子</rb><rb>大学生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>joshi</rt><rt>daigakusei</rt></rtc>
</ruby> and <ruby>
  <rtc>&nbsp;</rtc>
  <rbc><rb>男子</rb><rb>大学生</rb></rbc>
  <rtc><rt>danshi</rt><rt>daigakusei</rt></rtc>
</ruby> being "JD" and "DD" respectively... I have seen this occasionally, such 
as in some very real people's Twitter bios, but it isn't nearly as common as 
"JK" or even "DK."
{:.content__p_noindent}

Remember, Jisho.org is your friend… unless you’re trying to understand slang,
then you have a 50/50 shot with it.

## II. _The Manga_
{:#ii}

Finding all the chapters of this manga can be a bit of a challenge due to them 
mostly being one-shots in a sort-of shared universe; according to MAL there are 
30 chapters because it only counts chapters in the original two volumes (and 
leaving out two chapters from that); however there are 2 more chapters that 
were included in the re-release "jou" and "ge;" finally there's the "complete" 
edition which actually isn't complete, it cuts out a lot of chapters that were 
in the first two releases and slims it down to mostly just the "pollinic"
stories (for some reason excluding "Let's Go Pollinic Road", probably because 
the cowards were afraid of the based futa pollen cocks) and some other 
fan-favorites, which makes it a bit more thematically cohesive however it does 
cut some things which were quite fun in the originals.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

There are basically four character stories that actually have to do with the 
Pollinic Girls, and then all the others are unrelated: Hanazono, Aki, 
Otsu♡Mami, and Otani/Rui/Sally.

- Hanazono is an office lady (or "OL" as the kids say) who is not allergic to 
  cedar or japanese cypress, and is jealous of everyone else who gets to have 
  public sex during allergy season; however, it later turns out she is allergic 
  to ragweed.
- Aki is Hanazono-san's younger sister. She is a schoolgirl (or "JK" as the 
  kids say) and she has a crush on a boy who doesn't have allergies; however, 
  she's got them bad.
- Otsu♡Mami are a couple who have amazing sex, that's it, they're just awesome. 
- Rui is a rich girl who's never cum before (at the start of her arc), Sally is 
  her head maid and she is a queen, and Otani is her fuckboy.
- Oh I guess there's also the couple that go to WaniLand or whatever.

Anyway those 5 storylines are really all the "Pollinic" stories. Some part of 
all of those got animated, and every chapter of all of them, with the exception 
of "Let's Go Pollinic Road" (Otani/Rui/Sally), got translated. "My Wife is 
Tiny" and "Nudist Wife!?" are the chapters which weren't part of any pollinic 
storyline that got animated.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Chapters not officially translated:
{:.content__p_noindent}

- NEET's Big Adventure
- Wet Sound
- Magical Stage Dragnet
- The Pink Planet
- Forest Wolf-Girl
- Cat-Play
- Cat-Dream Believer
- Twin Love Secret
- Candyland
- Moon Girl
- Walking Priestesses
- Jurassic Priestesses
- Let's Go Pollinic Road

The NicoNico Dictionary [page on the author](
  https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E5%B0%8F%E6%A2%85%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%81%A8
) notes that Forest Wolf-Girl (森の狼っ娘) predates the more popular 
anthropomorphic wolf girl series Spice and Wolf (狼と香辛料). Would you believe 
me if I said the author has also published a few (non-H) Spice and Wolf fan 
books? An interesting tidbit, but one that is definitely overshadowed by the 
rest of the description of the author's typical content: tits (おっぱい), 
orgies (多人数Ｐ), and gags (ギャグ).
{:.content__p_noindent}

_**Edit:** It's rather embarrassing to admit, but I could not, for some reason, 
verify this information until I was editing the notes for publication. Koume 
Keito is the illustrator for the Spice and Wolf manga adaption, Isuna Hasekura 
being the writer for bother the light novel and manga._

We have a [full list of chapters](
  //docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ryWhtmqCfBAO3G5RhqHDz8D33cLO3rz-HLqoUqOvzc
) in each publication and the animation.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Personally (Chloe), some honorable mentions for best chapters outside of those pollinic storylines are: "Sharp Rise!? Stock Girls" "Twin Love Secret," "Candyland," the Priestesses arc, and "Cherry Blossom Crusade."

- "Stock Girls" follows a similar personification bit as the "pollinic girls" 
  stories but it's about stock exchange, and they have to fuck them to trade 
  them; finance geeks just be like that.
- "Twin Love Secret" is about a dude who finds out his girlfriend has actually 
  been two twins the whole time. So, he fucks them both, and then debates with 
  his two triplet brothers whether or not to tell them.
- "Candyland" is about a girl whose best gal pal confesses her love to her but 
  she rejects her! So, her friend fucks her brother... and also her mom... and 
  her dad, and drives her insane until she admits she loves her too.
- The Priestesses arc is about two twin Miko who are in ancient Rome, for some 
  reason, and then on an island with dinosaurs. And they fuck the emperor and 
  also a t-rex that they magically turned into a guy with two dicks.
- "Cherry Blossom Crusade" is about a girl who tries to help her friend get 
  with her brother, but then they all fall under the influence of a magic 
  cherry tree and have a threesome. Then the three of them just are in aa 
  incestuous polyamorous relationship together.

I (Una) would like to add "Pink Planet" (鏡のわくせい) to this list. This 
one-shot is about a space faring girl who has found herself stuck on an alien 
planet, desperately searching for the fuel pellets scattered during her crash. 
She finds a fruit that, when thrown into a lake, turns into a clone of herself. 
Two heads are better than one, but what about _a lot of heads?_ Anyway it's a 
big selfcest orgy and I love it.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Another important thing to mention is that there, canonically, are futa 
pollinic girls in Hokkaido. However, they only get two (color) panels that are 
unfortunately left untranslated due to being in the one untranslated pollinic 
girls chapter: "Let's Go Pollinic Road."

## III. _The Anime_
{:#iii}

The first two episodes follow the same sort of adaptation formula, where they 
adapt the first half of a chapter, then another chapter, and then the latter 
half of the initial chapter. Episode three just adapts three separate chapters 
straight through. Episode four follows a similar pattern to episodes 1 and 2, 
but inserts 2 chapters between the first and second half-chapters. This method 
of adaptation helps to create a feeling of shared continuity between stories in 
what's largely an anthology-ish series.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

### III-1. Volume 1
{:#iii-1}

Hanazono is the, like, main character for the most part? _**Edit:** according 
to statements by the author in an omake for the second volume, Kano Aki is the 
heroine._

> _"As a model for pollen allergy I've decided to use Kano Aki-chan. I know the 
  guys wanted to see all the girls around men, but I wanted to draw lots of 
  girls instead!<br/>
  As the manga's heroine, she wears the popular twintails hairstyle, but the 
  actual reason is that it's the same hair as a certain queen in a really old 
  shoujo anime I saw...<br/>
  I'm drawing another manga with Aki-chan as the heroine!"_[^1]

[^1]:
    小梅けいと, _花粉少女2!: The Pollinic Girls Counter Attack!!_, trans. 
    Yuribou (Wani Magazine, 2010), omake 5. 

The pollen bit is really good, but then they just drop it for this whole 
fucking "I can't cum" bit. Huge disappointment that there is not pollen in this 
scene, despite being outside. They later explain that the mansion has a perfect 
air filtration system, but this does not explain the scene by the pool.

Sally is clearly a god.
{:.content__p_noindent}

A better theory than Sally's whole "your heart is still a virgin" thing is just 
that nobody seems aware of the clit? But _nooo_, she needs a man despite having 
all these maids pegging her. This was not the case in the manga, as she had a 
collection of men to fuck both her and Sally.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Sally then runs into Otani while on the train. Evidently, Otani and Rui (the girl who cannot cum) know each other from somewhere, and Sally brings him in as the solution to Rui's dilemma. Thus, Otani and Rui fuck for hours. The same animation shows every time he cums, like a magical girl transformation.
{:.content__p_noindent}

"You can be my orgy-pet _and_ my friend." So says Rui to Otani.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Then they return to the whole pollen bit, _finally_, and introduce Hanazono's 
little sister, Aki, for some reason. She seems chill about the whole pollen 
thing at least. Also seems chill about being photographed while getting fucked 
by a whole bunch of catgirls in public?

_**Edit:** the Japanese cedar (sugi) pollen appears to have cat ears in the 
anime. This is a somewhat common occurance while some characters in anime, 
giving short, perky hair the appearance of having ears. The author's statement 
on the design of the cedar pollen is as follows:_
{:.content__p_noindent}

> _"Blonde hair, blue eyes, big tits. Personality: energetic and wild. 
  Widespread from Kyushu to Honshu. Likes to have sex in threes or more. 
  Often introduced to patients by joining in with other pollen girls._

> _"This was the first pollen girl that I drew. I envisaged her as the 
  energetic one, so she ended up with blonde short hair. She was easy to draw 
  so she appears a lot..."_[^2]

[^2]: 小梅, _Pollinic Girls Counterattack!!_, omake 1.

_In the manga, the pollinic girls do have cat ears at one point, however. In 
the Wani Land chapter, Exhilirating Pollinic Girls Land, specifically during 
the parade scenes, the wear cat ears to fit the festive vibe._
{:.content__p_noindent}

Hanazono, despite having no cedar or cypress allergies thus being left out of 
everything, apparently does have ragweed allergies. Ragweed is boys! Also, her 
coworker just joins in out of "solidarity" (she's probably just into it, 
honestly, callback to her previously stating that it was exciting to be
watched).
{:.content__p_noindent}

### III-2. Volume 2
{:#iii-2}

Opens up to the little sister character, Aki, in her room getting pounced on by 
a bunch of catgirls. She puts tape over her pussy so the pollen can't get to 
it. Supposedly, she doesn't wear panties because cedar pollen just goes right 
through them.

Then Aki gets on the bust. At the end of the tunnel of bitches is her crush. 
We're back to cedar and cypress season, apparently. The tape gets removed 
immediately. She's really flustered that her crush is right there watchihng 
her, though he does seem to be respectfully looking away. Then, of course, like 
a gentleman, he offers her his handkerchief. "Seasonal allergies is so 
embarrassing. I hate it!" she exclaims.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Then we cut to some random girl doing anal with her husband (the pictures on 
the wall show they are clearly married). This is another really stupid bit (and 
not just because it doesn't include pollen). The real cool manly man plays with 
her clit, confirming that the author is, in fact, aware that it exists. After 
they finish, they reveal the whole bit, being that she can't take his cock. 
"You need to get bigger." She's 21, by the way. "It's because my pussy is too 
small." Also, she has twintails and is named Miku. Classic tsundere short girl.

Back in the same office, of course this is where the husband, Aki, works. The 
ragweed is here, so Hanazono is getting dicked down while trying to hand him 
reference materials. Hanazono making some comment about her pussy getting 
stretched out gives him _an idea_.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Cut to a small arrangement of sex toys. That's right, he's going to stretch his 
wife's pussy out. Leaving the toy inside, aha. 
{:.content__p_noindent}

Montage of her going around doing her wifely chores and shit with a dildo in 
her pussy. Getting horny at every little thing. Then, a few interspersed scenes 
of her getting measured and stretched by Aki. Some day, they will be able to 
fuck!
{:.conetent__p_noindent}

Back on the bus. Aki, the little sister, is standing next to her crush again. 
Miku is "jealous of all these kids with allergies."
{:.content__p_noindent}

Okachinchin~ translated as "welcome homedick"??? (The manga translates this as 
"Welcome home, penis. Welcum home.") Aki is just as confused as the rest of us 
at the phrase. Miku is really fucking horny at this point. "Put it all the way 
in and measure me." Then they have sex. Aki notes that she is tight, almost so 
much that it hurts. What an empath! Shoutout to the shots of the photos in the 
back. He fills her up with a _week's worth of cum_ using the _same animation_ 
as previous cums. Now she wants to make his dick bigger, a huge win for womens' 
rights. 
{:.content__p_noindent}

Classic establishing shot of a school here. Girls hanging out on the roof, 
chatting with the homies, getting their pussies eaten by the pollen. Aki is 
worried that people think girls with seasonal allergies are dirty, probably 
because of all the sex. 

Suddenly, it is evening. Wow! Sugita, Aki's crush, walks in on Yuri, Aki's 
friend, getting dicked down by some ragweed. She claims that the way to fix 
seasonal allergies is the semen of a boy who isn't suffering from allergies... 
so she sucks Sugita's dick. Then Aki shows up, declaring that she cannot give 
up on her love after all. "I'm full of cum and perverted." Yuri resigns herself 
to the ragweed, while Aki and Sugita have a whole romantic moment. "You're 
beautiful when you have allergies." Anyway, they fuck on the classroom desk. 
Yuri gets double penetrated while Aki and Sugita are still just having normal 
sex on the desk like loser heterosexuals. (I mean, the pollen is still sucking 
on her nipples and stuff, which is neat, I guess). The scene ends with the 
girls sprawled out, completely worn out on desks getting licked by the pollen.
{:.content__p_noindent}

_**Edit:** we previously didn't mention how much this scene was changed for the 
anime. For starters, it wasn't in the evening, but during the school day. It 
was not just the three of them in the classroom at the time, the whole class 
was there... cheering them on for the romantic development of this scene._
{:.content__p_noindent}

Aki has now resigned herself to the pollen, having learned her crush does not 
look down on her for having allergies, not even wearing a skirt to school 
anymore. She wears her panties on the outside of the garters, meaning she fully 
intends on them being removed.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### III-3. Volume 3
{:#iii-3}

This one starts in a water park. Got maids at the pool... because Rui's story 
is back! And cumming more than ever! "So this living vibrator belonged to you?" 
she asks Aki, regarding Sugita. It's okay, she loans out Sally as a replacement.
Clear (very pronounced) evidence of clitoris in this one. Like, Sally is _very_ 
focused on it. Then Aki pulls an MLG Epic Gamer strat by throwing a jar of 
pollen in the air. "I, Sugita Hinoki, am weak in both holes." The distraction 
works and Aki and Sugita are now just fucking in public like ballers.

The next scene is an adaptation of the whole nudist lifestyle chapter. This is 
tied into the pollinic girls thing purely with showing them outside the window 
in establishing shots. They spent their honeymoon naked on a deserted island. 
Not so much nudism in the attempting to de-sexualize nudity, very explicitly 
sexual about it.

She calls her husband "Darling." Anyway, the next day she's just doing sexy 
cosplay because she was too embarrassed by pure nudity and now she's even more 
embarrassed! Foot stuff. The husband comes up with this great compromise where, 
since she doesn't want to wear nothing, then she should wear his cum. This is 
what they call "hentai logic." This is also where they insert the whole bit of 
her being up against the window because "your body needs lots of sunlight to 
produce Vitamin D." This is an excellent excuse to bring up the whole milk 
wipers thing! "Semen shirt." He said "semen shirt."
{:.content__p_noindent}

Next scene just cuts straight to an orgy. They are in an elevator, which isn't 
clear at first. It's the Otsu♡Mami arc! They're out in town, surrounded by... 
sex! Wow! Out in public, Mami needs to change her pollen mask, but Otsu decides 
that he might as well justm uhhm clean her off with his tongue (he really wants 
to fuck in the park). He pulls out the other "mask" with the "beaded tampon" 
and fucks her with it, which gets it all soaked. えっちしよ〜 (Let's fuck). Who 
doesn't want to fuck a blue haired girl in public? Plus she has a choker, cute! 
Despite everyone else in the park fucking pollinic girls, they all just _have 
to_ pay attention to the normal people having sex in the park. "I'm sorry your 
wife is a whore." "おちんちん、ちんぽ、好きだよ!" Queen, absolute queen. Mami 
is all passed out while Otsu desperately asks for her help as he is getting 
pegged by a bunch of Pollinic Boys… oh no!

_**Edit:** all the ragweed pollen boys look like pathetic little twinks, which the author does, in fact, acknowledge:_
{:.content__p_noindent}

### III-4. Volume 4
{:#iii-4}

This episode takes place at an amusement park. This couple (Ami and Ken) is on 
a date, trying to make good memories. Sally is here! My queen! So they run 
around to different rides trying to find one that isn't covered with people 
fucking pollen. Ami suggests the roller coaster, because it's too high up and 
fast for pollen... but the wait time is 2 whole hours (they run into Aki here). 
Different from the manga here, they decide to go onto the ferris wheel, where 
they both get fucked by the pollen, of course. "Don't moan so sexily like 
that..." dude just cums from that, all over her. _And then Ami cums too_, 
hurray! Ami runs away while Sally watches all menacing from the ferris wheel.

Next scene, the Otsu♡Mami arc is back! Mami is sitting on the toilet, when she gets attacked by tentacles!! Tentacles start squirting "strange things" all over her, and go right into her ass with a bit of teasing... then she pisses all over. "I peed... I peed so much... all over."

Cut to Mami being mad at Otsu about the tentacles. Then they start talking 
about all the magazines piled up... how they should be tied up... but first he 
needs some practice... by tying her up, of course! "I figured something like 
this might happen," he claims, as all the anchor points and pulleys on the 
ceiling are shown. He is a king. Possibly the best animated blowjob I've ever 
seen. This whole scene is really good, but they keep doing cuts of the pulleys 
on the ceiling which is a bit unnecessary, but Mami's voice while she pleads 
for his cock could carry this whole thing alone. She claims to have gotten 
sluttier just because he does naughty things to her all the time, I mean, who 
wouldn't.

"Many days later." Mami has tied up everything in the house, shibari style... including herself.

And now we’re back to the amusement park. Ken is looking for Ami, and Sally 
tells him she knows where Ami is. Ami is, of course, in a warehouse, on a 
throne, getting licked all over by pollen girls. Ami is now desperate, pleading 
for Ken's cock, wanting him to be her first before the pollen takes her 
virginity. There's blood from her losing her first time, perpetuating a harmful 
stereotype about sex with virgins. Suddenly, the doors of the warehouse open, 
an announcement says the parade will begin! Ami, of course, doesn't want to 
stop fucking, while the throne turns out to obviously be a parade float. So 
there they are, atop a float for all to see, fucking in full view. 10/10... no, 
Aki is here too for some reason, 2/10 at best. They're doing the thing where 
they show all the other characters again, really trying to tie in all the 
stories. A few cuts later and Aki and Rui are making out while getting fucked 
by their respective guys, titties bumping and stuff. Pretty neat.

## IV. _Conclusion_
{:#iv}

Chloe's review: "I'd rate it about a 3: better than Sword Art Online 
Alicization: War of Underworld Part 2 but not as good as Sword Art Online. The 
manga however, including all the untranslated chapters, I'd probably rate about 
a 5; if you're looking for good masturbation material it's probably best to 
look somewhere else, but if you're looking for sex comedy with occasionally 
good jerk off material then I'd say give it a chance.

"I think, for the most part, the 'pollinic girls' thing is a really good bit 
that kinda gets wasted on schoolgirls and too many of the stories don't 
actually contain that theme itself. Otsu♡Mami is life, Sally is a queen, and 
the Walking Miko deserve more stories, to be honest."

Una's review: "The anime is a 2/10; the manga is a 3/10; and Otsu♡Mami on its 
own is a 9/10."
