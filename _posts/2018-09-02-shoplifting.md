 - Intro
   - C: _"Good Sextidi, everyone, and welcome to part one (1) of Goth Angel
     Sinners, a podcast about anarchy, anarchists, and anarchism, and not about
     Lil Peep."_
   - T: _"We’re your hosts, I’m @trewbot..."_
   - C: _"...and I’m Chloe (Χλόη)..."_
   - T: _"...here today to talk about shoplifting."_
 - Two main arguments against shoplifting:
   - People who maybe almost have a sense of decency and think it hurts workers
     - Wrong, but if they’re genuinely concerned with that (our research shows
       most of them aren’t) then at least they aren’t the worst person in the
       world.
     - Companies are financially incentivized to assume there will be some
       shrink due to theft (both external and internal), which indicates that
       there is no direct effect on workers but also none on the company itself
       [**refer back to this when discussing praxis**].
     - 43% of total losses in retail come from employee theft, so clearly
       employees don’t give a fuck.[^1]
       - To quote Wikipedia here: “Because associates have access to the entire
         building and during non-business hours, they are capable of creating
         substantial losses to the company over a longer period of time.” Which
         is extremely radical.[^2]
       - Also, as long as I’m quoting Wikipedia, the page on loss prevention
         also contains this hilarious bit: “The vast majority of thieves have
         one thing in common, they will steal only if they have the opportunity.
         So theft prevention is fairly easy.”
     - According to a 2005 report from the Food Marketing Institute, the most
       commonly stolen items from grocery stores were meat, over-the-counter
       medicine, baby formula, and health and beauty products[^3]
     - So like i was trying to find statistics about employees being fired or
       punished or if it was even legal to do so because of shoplifters and I
       literally can only find news articles about people being fired for not
       just letting shoplifters go
       - When i searched “shoplifting hurts workers” i found thinkpieces from
         conservatives with no data….and more information about how employees
         are more responsible for losses than shoplifters...
     - It’s almost like the idea that shoplifting hurts workers is a scam pushed
       by those with institutional power in order to get those they have
       institutional power over to hate those with no power
       - It’s not shoplifters that do anything to hurt workers, they just took a
         thing, it’s bosses, and if you have a problem with the way bosses
         punish workers, perhaps try organizing unions
     - Yeah all I can really find is that most people are grossly misinformed on
       workers’ rights and on unions, in which case anyone who really cared
       about the wellbeing of workers would be educating and organizing on
       workers rights and unions rather than just blaming shoplifters for the
       actions of bosses
       - Wage theft is a thing, and it happens in every industry, not just
         retail, your boss is looking for any reason to fuck you over, it’s not
         shoplifters[^4]
     - This is the part where I plug my article on this topic, because it covers
       most of these points from a ground up theoretical perspective.
     - A similar argument I’ve seen less often is that theft of particular items
       leads to stores no longer stocking said items, this relates to a topic
       further down in the effects on smaller businesses that can’t employ loss
       projections.
       - This is, of course, very absurd if you’ve ever been in a store since
         the items that are subject to the most opportunistic theft (deodorant,
         condoms, sometimes shampoo, I don’t have a source on this it’s all
         anecdotal) are still sold, but in locked cases.
   - Businesscucks who believe stealing is wrong
     - Legality -/-> morality
       - It is necessary for any economic system to be backed by a cultural
         assumption that said system is right. (This stands for anarchism as
         well, that is to say this is a motherfucking culture war).
       - Arguing against shoplifters is not only defending the status quo of
         capitalism but is a necessity to ensure that the boom and bust cycle of
         capitalism does not lead to its complete collapse.
       - \[insert Kropotkin quote here\][^5]
         - The Law isn’t necessary, people wouldn’t just be killing each other
           without laws
         - Most murders throughout history have been legally sanctioned
           (genocide, war, death penalties, police murders, etc)
         - \[insert Howard Zinn quote here\][^6]
         - From an evolutionary perspective it just wouldn’t make sense for it
           to be ingrained in human biology to be manipulative, exploitative,
           murderous, and “evil” towards fellow humans, we are social creatures,
           not individual creatures, we thrive on cooperation
         - Violent, antisocial behaviors in people are created by the societies
           they live in, social inequality and unmet needs are the greatest
           contributors to interpersonal violence[^7]
     - Not all stealing is shoplifting
       - People are worried that people won’t have class consciousness, and
         that’s why we shouldn’t encourage class consciousness(?)
       - People seem to think “shoplifting is good” means “armed robbery is
         good” or “home invasion is good”, but these are all clearly different
         and if you disagree you are wrong
       - Stealing and intention to part with the item:
         - Businesses, by definition, have their products in excess, if they
           didn’t have anything in excess they wouldn’t have things to sell
         - Literally they are actively trying to get rid of things, the
           stipulation is that they want people to pay them for the stuff they
           don’t need and the people do need
           - This is where I point out that small businesses do literally the
             same thing: if they’re a store, they have excess, doesn’t matter if
             they’re big or small
         - Meanwhile if you break into someone’s home, you have no idea what
           stuff they intend on parting with, except if you wanna dig through
           their trash can
         - Stealing a TV from Best Buy =/= stealing a TV from your neighbor
       - Prices are literally just a restriction on the efficient distribution
         of resources
 - What does shoplifting do as far as anti-capitalist praxis goes?
   - I guess the first thing is who cares? Not every action has to be such a
     large act that it alone will bring down capitalism, getting out of bed
     doesn’t stop capitalism but we still do it
   - Creating a culture which doesn’t respect property rights and instead
     prioritizes human needs and desires is a good anti-capitalist thing
   - People getting their needs met here and now is good, it’s a constructive
     behavior not a destructive one, it’s about making the lives of the
     oppressed better, not necessarily ruining businesses
 - What do we need in a cultural shift towards post-capitalism and anarchism?
   (Further specification of points made earlier).
   - Property rights / ownership fucking merced.
     - What is ownership? Violence. Next question.
       - BuT wHaT iS vIoLeNcE?!?!
     - Distinctions between private/personal property, maybe use the LP-LSC’s
       language here since it works a bit better with “Americans.”
       - The language typically used to draw the line between something like
         shoplifting and robbing somebody’s house is, at least among leftists,
         “private” versus “personal” property. Here “personal” property refers
         to items intended for personal use, such as the common example of your
         toothbrush; whereas “private” property is a legal relationship that
         defines the restrictions of other people from using said item. More
         simply put private property is something that is owned but not used by
         the person under this definition.
       - However, private property has other more common definitions so it isn’t
         beneficial to use this terminology. Property that is owned but not used
         could more aptly be called “absentee ownership.”
