Kinokuniya, [the bookstore](https://usa.kinokuniya.com/), has no relation to
[Kinokuniya Bunzaemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinokuniya_Bunzaemon). This
really threw me off when reading
[Reigokai's translation](https://isekailunatic.com/tsuki-ga-michibiku-isekai-douchuu/)
of the TsukiMichi: Moonlit Fantasy (月が導く異世界道中)
[web novel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tsuki-ga-michibiku-isekai-douchuu/).
In chapter 324, [Tomoe](https://anidb.net/character/113329) describes
[Rembrandt](https://anidb.net/character/117383)'s sudden interest in the
construction methods of the main character's company like so:
{:.dropcap}

> "I am impressed that that man is trying to replicate this. Not only Echigoya,
> he is even aiming for the Kinokuniya. He is capable."[^fn1]

This statement took me a while to process. See, my mind immediately associates
the name Kinokuniya with a bookstore, which doesn't have anything to do with
construction methodology, right? Then there's the parallels being drawn between
Kinokuniya and Echigoya, which is a name I honestly don't recognize. Tomoe and
to a lesser extent [Makoto](https://anidb.net/character/113330) constantly
reference things from the Edo Period, so I was getting used to just glazing over
this kind of thing. Like, the building they're constructing is meant to be a
[_yoseba_](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%AF%84%E5%A0%B4), which is pretty esoteric.
Kinokuniya, though, is a name I've seen before, so I just had to dig into it a
little. Honestly, I have always wondered why the bookshop was called that, so
this is basically just me forcing myself to actually figure it out!
{:.no-indent}

If you ask the internet what _kinokuniya_ means, English
[sources](https://www.nihongomaster.com/japanese/dictionary/word/21083/) for
learning Japanese will typically just tell you that it is the name of a
bookshop. Obviously, this is not the whole story. _Kinokuniya_ as a
transliteration of the Japanese "紀伊國屋" is indeed the name of a bookshop, but
also the name of the legendary merchant Kinokuniya Bunzaemon, the less legendary
merchant Kinokuniya Bunemon,[^fn3] and some
[Kabuki actor](<https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%80%E4%BC%8A%E5%9C%8B%E5%B1%8B_(%E6%AD%8C%E8%88%9E%E4%BC%8E)>).
Still, _kinokuniya_ could also be a transliteration of the name of a supermarket
([紀ノ国屋](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%80%E3%83%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%B1%8B))
or the name of a sweets shop
([紀の國屋](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%80%E3%81%AE%E5%9B%BD%E5%B1%8B)).

This can seem fairly confusing due to a number of sources claiming that
_kinokuniya_ translates to "bookstore of the Kii province," possibly based on a
misreading[^fn4] of a part of the
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_Kinokuniya) on the
bookstore. In fairness, the article is somewhat confusing regarding this, as the
full Japanese name for the company, 紀伊国屋書店, could be translated as such.
More literally, this reads as "Kii Province store bookshop" or just "Kinokuniya
Bookshop." Of course, it is for this very reason that the English name for the
company is "Books Kinokuniya." This distinguishes the company from those other
stores and denotes the market of the business, which makes sense given that it
did start out as a lumber dealer before the original store was destroyed in the
1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.
{:.no-indent}

The attentive among you may have noticed that these translations all refer to
Kii Province, yet the name does not include that second _i_. This is one of the
many cases where the Japanese language is simply fucking with you. While the
kanji [紀](http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1MKU7d00) is certainly read
as _ki_, as in the terms [日本書紀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Shoki)
or [世紀](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80#Japanese), the kanji
[伊](http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1MKU4f0a) would appear to be read
_no_ instead of _i_ as one would expect. You should certainly expect this, it's
the same kanji you'd find in Iga
([伊賀](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E8%B3%80)), like the
[ninjas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga-ry%C5%AB), or the _ateji_[^fn5] name
of Italy ([伊太利](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E5%A4%AA%E5%88%A9)).
So why is this the case?
{:.no-indent}

This is a question that definitely, probably, almost has some form of an answer.
Let's take a little stroll through history to the 7<sup>th</sup> century here.
In the Kansai region, on a peninsula south of Osaka, the province initially
known as Kinokuni (木国) was founded.[^fn6] It's name was likely derived from
the abundance of forests in the area; there doesn't seem to be much evidence to
this claim, but why else would you call it "tree country?" It's immediately
obvious that we're dealing with one of those funny phenomena in the reading of
this: the _no_ is not written in the name. This is actually a common occurrence
with place names in Japan,[^fn7] both _no_ and _ga_ are frequently left to
inference, though the latter has in some cases been given the incredibly
confusing character "ヶ" to represent it. This may seem like an absurd way to
write names, but it makes sense when you consider the way kanji was merely
adopted as a means to write preexisting words and names in Japan. With the
initial adoption, some considered the writing to be a tad chaotic, obviously
something had to be done about this.

In 713 (和銅 6 年), an imperial edict was issued to fix up this system by
dictating that all provinces ought to have their names written with two
'auspicious' characters (好字).[^fn8a][^fn8b][^fn8c] Evidently the kanji for
tree wasn't auspicious enough,[^fn9] so it was to be replaced, but what about
that two character rule? This became a source of many inconsistent readings of
kanji throughout the country, though in this specific instance they merely
elongated the vowel, turning 木 into 紀伊.[^fn10] Despite it then being written
_kii,_ it was frequently still read simply as _ki_. Thus, it's not that 伊 is
read as _no,_ it simply is not read at all, and the _no_ is inferred separately.
Isn't that fantastic?
{:.no-indent}

Just going to put this out here now, lest it suddenly pop up later and leave you
all confused: Kinokuni was also called Kishu (紀州). Why? I don't know, man, I
don't fucking know.[^fn11] _Shuu_ (州) basically means 'state,' like it's a
suffix used for US states: ミネソタ州. All the provinces had aliases like this
for some reason.
{:.no-indent}

Is this a satisfying place to end? There's a lot of other stuff I could talk
about, but it feels a bit tangential. The history of the province is pretty
interesting, there's a whole bunch of stuff about warrior monks and samurai.
Going over that stuff would give a somewhat clearer picture about the
bookstore's name. Then there's the legend of Kinokuniya Bunzaemon. Of course, I
could go on about the various things named after the place, like the mikan and
the dog breed. So, if you want me to write about that, then beg?

    From what I can tell, the idea of an auspicious kanji at the time was more
    or less just a vibe. It seems that, since the whole naming convention of the
    two kanji was based on place names in Tang Dynasty China, the kanji chosen
    to be in those names were also supposed to parallel the characters used in
    China. As far as I can tell, no name retained the character for tree, though
    some kept 松 which is basically the same who cares.

    On the one hand, I could try to figure this out. On the other hand, it kinda
    just makes sense in its own way. On a third, secret hand, I searched for
    "Kishu" and the first two results were about a cryptocurrency likely trying
    to parallel Doge Coin and its Shiba Inu aesthetic with "Kishu Inu," one of
    the common names for Kishu Ken. A lot of things are named after Kishu,
    including a breed of hunting dogs. How cute.
