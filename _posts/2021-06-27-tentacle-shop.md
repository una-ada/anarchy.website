## Preface

Hello everyone! I'm Chloe... _and I'm Una..._ and welcome to the second 
installment of Chloe and Una's Tentacular Experience, a weekly podcast bringing 
you the hottest hentai reviews for your slutty slutty ears. Today we're going 
to be talking about a hentai manga that is very special to both of us, _Anata no
Machi no Shokushuyasan_, or Your Neighborhood Tentacle Shop. A little different 
than last time because it's something that's currently publishing and, as of 
now, has no anime adaptation (which is a violation of the Geneva Convention). 
But as usual, anytime one of us discovers a new fetish we will be playing this 
sound [sound].
{:.dropcap}

Thanks to all, uh, four of the people (none of which were Chloe) who listened to the last episode and we hope you enjoy this one too!
{:p_noindent}

## I. _Background_
{:#i}

Tentacle hentai is frequently referred to as "tentacle rape" in English, which 
is not necessarily incorrect given the often unconsensual nature of the works 
in this category&mdash;Your Neighborhood Tentacle Shop is perhaps notable here 
in contrast. However, to fulfill the educational goals of this podcast, we're 
going to break down a few different terms relating to the genre in Japanese.
{:.dropcap}

_Shokushu_ is the Japanese word for "tentacle." People like to point out that 
the term "arms" is more fitting, as a "tentacle" is a specific feature of 
certain species and not present in something like an octopus, but we'll stick 
to the colloquial understanding as it gives a distinction between the "arms" 
we're speaking of and those of, say, humans.

_Shokushu kan_ would be the most literal equivalent to "tentacle rape" in 
Japanese. The word _kan_ is, similar to the word "rape," a general term for 
illicit sexual acts. While this does explicitly include rape (_goukan_), it may 
also include adultery (_kantsuu_), bestiality (_juukan_, historically also used 
for sodomy), etc.
{:.no-indent}

_Shokushu zeme_ is, on the other hand, a fairly common term in the genre which 
does not indicate that the contents are non-consensual. Rather, _zeme_ here 
(generally read as _seme_ but voiced due to _rendaku_) is a word used for 
tormenting someone in a sexual context. This is more frequently translated as 
"abuse" or "torture," but the word "torment" is being used here as I feel it is 
more fitting for sexual acts.
{:.no-indent}

Moving on to some vocabulary used in the manga itself!

Chapter 4 introduces two new characters as _Gachi Rezu A_ and _B_. One 
translation changes this term to "patron," likely to either avoid attempting to 
find a succinct translation or to avoid any controversy that might come with 
it. To understand this term, let's discuss each word in turn:

_Gachi_ is a common term in colloquial Japanese used for emphasis. You can read 
it as "hella."
{:.no-indent}

_Rezu_ is technically a term for lesbian, being an abbreviation of the loan 
word _rezubian_. However, like the term "lesbo" in English, it has taken on a 
connotation of being applied to others in a fetishistic sense rather than to 
oneself as a sexual identification. The term _bian_ has thus replaced it in the 
latter case.
{:.no-indent}

In combination, the term _gachi rezu_ may be read as "mega lesbo" or something 
along those lines. It has, in some places, been translated as "open," 
"obvious," or "crazy lesbian." Of course, as with all terms which may be 
considered derogatory, there have been Japanese lesbians who have used the term 
for themselves, but it's best to understand the linguistic context of such a 
choice.
{:.no-indent}

Sidenote: A sort of antidote to the term exists with _heta rezu_, approximately 
meaning "awkward lesbian." Generally, _heta_ can mean "lazy," but I don't think 
that's really relevant to understanding this term itself. 

## II. _The Manga_
{:#ii}

### II-1. Characters
{:#ii-1}

#### II-1.1 Naedoko Matsuri (苗床 真津梨)
{:#ii-1-1}

Our protagonist, Matsuri, is a newcomer to the world of tentacles. Frequently 
described as a "voracious monster of lust," she's prone to melting at the sight 
of a hot tangle of tentacles. Her weak spot is her breasts.

#### II-1.2 Naia Yurika (凪愛 百合香)
{:#ii-1-2}

Yurika is the "mysterious tentacle shop owner." An educator who truly cares 
about her customers' needs. Breeds tentacles for maximum pleasure and
utility... hot sleep-deprived tentacle mommy, uwu. _Chloe has definitely 
compared her to a "mushroom guy" or something, which is funny, to me (Una)._

#### II-1.3 Emya (エーミャ)
{:#ii-1-3}

Emya, or just Emi (エミ), is a veteran tentacle user, tentacle shop regular, 
friend of Yurika, and willing test subject for new tentacles. "The number of 
tentacles she's given birth to is uncountable," like, she says she's addicted 
to giving birth.

#### II-1.4 Naedoko Utage (苗床 宴)
{:#ii-1-4}

Utage is Matsuri's older sister and apparently even more of a nympho. Into 
being dominated by large and powerful tentacle monsters, such as Hugs. 
Unemployed but refuses to work for the tentacle shop because it would be "bad 
for her health."

#### II-1.5 Shogo-tan (ショゴたん)
{:#ii-1-5}

Shogo is a sentient tentacle colony that acts as Yurika's assistant and a 
frequent sexual partner (perhaps love interest?) to Matsuri, as well as her 
mentor as an employee of the tentacle shop. Shogo is hot.

#### II-1.6 Shiraki Sumire (白木 菫)
{:#ii-1-6}

Sumire is Matsuri's friend from school. She's not in the series much but the 
author did say there's probably going to be a side story featuring her.

#### II-1.7 Kohinata Elena (小日向 エレナ)
{:#ii-1-7}

Elena is a character who only shows up briefly to check in to a three day long 
appointment with one "Goliath."

#### II-1.8 "Patron" A (ガチレズA) / Karen (夏恋)
{:#ii-1-8}

Karen is half of the one notable lesbian couple in the series, despite the 
author just sort of never including any men whatsoever in this entire world. 
She's gay, dating Uniko, weak spot is her butt, that's about it.

#### II-1.9 "Patron" B (ガチレズB) / Uniko (うにこ)
{:#ii-1-9}

Uniko's entire character is just gay, :3, and vibing.

### II-2. Summary
{:#ii-2}

#### II-2.1 Chapter 1
{:#ii-2-1}

In Chapter 1, Matsuri enters the tentacle shop for the first time, Yurika (the 
owner) is helpful in recommending a first tentacle and explains to her proper 
tentacle care. Enter Emi-chan who kinda got addicted to giving birth. Matsuri 
buys some instant tentacles and takes them home and prepares them. The 
tentacles then fuck her, including finding her weak spot (her nipples) and 
fucking her pussy and her ass. Her sister comes home several hours later to 
find her just brain-broken and drooling on the floor.

#### II-2.2 Chapter 2
{:#ii-2-2}

Chapter 2 opens with Matsuri masturbating with her tentacles, saying she's 
"gonna get a weird kink" if she does this again, joke's on her she already has 
one. Cut to her and Emi in the shop discussing tentacles. Yurika offers some 
important sex ed knowledge. Emi tells Matsuri about "mimic" class tentacles 
which take the form of everyday objects and then pulls users inside and fucks 
them for hours, also she's sitting on one right now and _ooooh nooooo_ she's 
getting fucked.

#### II-2.3 Chapter 3
{:#ii-2-3}

Having been informed by Yurika that they're not allowed to fuck tentacles in 
the shop, but that they have fitting rooms available, Matsuri heads into the 
fitting room to have a massive tentacle orgy; however, having been reminded 
that the fitting rooms exist Emi takes a mass of tentacles back there first and 
leaves Matsuri waiting, horny, for the room to open up. While waiting, Matsuri 
gets eaten out by a humanoid tentacle colony, Shogo (Yurika's assistant). Shogo 
then incorporates the tentacles Matsuri wants to try into its body and fucks 
her brains out.

#### II-2.4 Chapter 3.5
{:#ii-2-4}

Chapter 3.5 stars Matsuri's older sister, Utage, and follows her visit to the 
tentacle shop, in which she uses a fitting room to fuck a massive tentacle 
monster named "Hug" (because it squeezes her real hard). She likes fucking big 
strong tentacle monsters, that's her thing.

#### II-2.5 Chapter 4
{:#ii-2-5}

Matsuri is out of money because she spent it all on tentacles, so she needs a 
job. Luckily for her, Yurika has been stalking her and offers her a job at the 
tentacle shop. On her first day, Yurika informs her that there's no "self help" 
allowed on the job, meaning she can't jack off at work, which I think is a 
violation of labor laws, but whatever. She gets increasingly horny helping 
customers, including a pair of lesbians (who are probably important) who she 
gives some lovely sex ed advice to. As a reward for not masturbating at work, 
once Matsuri's shift is done, Shogo takes her into the back and fucks her 
brains out. I think Matsuri's gonna date the tentacle colony.

#### II-2.6 Chapter 4.5
{:#ii-2-6}

Chapter 4.5 is a side story revolving around the lesbian couple shown in the 
previous chapter, Karen and Uniko. After waking up and realizing _something_, 
Uniko casually walks into the tentacle shop (before opening) and explains that 
her girlfriend, Karen, had an issue with her tentacles. Yurika drags Matsuri 
along to go address the situation after realizing what was happening; then 
Uniko fully explains that rather than taking a single tentacle egg<sup>?</sup> 
as per the instructions, Karen ate the entire box, and that's why she is 
completely stuffed with tentacles.

Yurika attempts to yank them all out, then has Matsuri help... they fail, of 
course, and call in ***TERABULK***, the big starfish looking monster, which 
pulls everything out with a single pull. It's not over yet, tho, as Yurika 
explains that Karen is still full of eggs! So even more tentacles are brought 
into the situation to pull each and every egg out of her insides (such an 
amazing spectacle that Uniko records the whole thing and Matsuri masturbates to 
it).
{:.no-indent}

The tentacles Karen was full of in this chapter are the 腸内環境改善共生生物タイプ 
(_chounaikankyou kaizen kyousei seibutsu taipu_, "intestinal environment 
improvement symbiotic type"), basically tapeworms.

## III. _Review_
{:#iii}

### III-1 Art
{:#iii-1}

Good (thumbs up), very consistent and enjoyable to look at. There's a lot of 
detail, like a lot; intense scenes tend to be entire pages of tentacles, SFX, 
and moaning. This is probably why the chapters all take so long, and if so then 
I don't care how long I have to wait... well, I do, a little.

The way the artist draws hair is nice, it looks a lot like the tentacles, it's 
cool.

### III-2 Tentacle Hentai as Sexual Education
{:#iii-2}

Throughout the series, Yurika is shown to take her job very seriously, to the 
point that she seems to see herself in part as a sex educator, and caring for 
the sexual liberation of her customers. This is shown in Chapter 1, when she 
says "by the way, are you good at pleasing yourself? Sorry. I'm talking about 
masturbation. Don't worry, you don't have to answer," which is something an 
employee at a sex shop would absolutely ask someone who was inexperienced in 
attempt to help them. She also says things like "it's never a bad thing to know 
more about your own erogenous zones". In Chapter 3, she avoids letting Matsuri 
sample the tentacles while under the influence of an airborne aphrodisiac, 
showing responsibility in her craft as well. All around a great person to trust 
with one's sexual well-being.

There's also a point in the manga where Matsuri, when talking about a tentacle 
to some customers, goes on a long tangent about the value of training one's 
kegel muscles. At points it feels like the author is using the background of 
incredibly hot, utterly impossible fantasies of tentacle fucking as a platform 
for explaining some important concepts of sexual health.

Also Shogo's fucking hot. **"_FUCK ME_, SHOGO!"**

### III-3 Will there be femboys?
{:#iii-3}

The beginning of Chapter 4 includes a news article about the rise in demand for 
male-use tentacles, which may be foreshadowing the possible future inclusion of 
men in the series. When asked if there are any men in the world of this manga 
on Twitter, the author replied by saying "内緒です😊😊😊😊😊😊" ("It's a secret" 
followed by six smiling face with smiling eyes emojis). We can really read into 
this!

Some of the author's other works do include men, but typically in "dominant" 
positions, so seeing one in a "submissive" position (i.e. having his brains 
fucked out by tentacles) would be a fun and interesting inclusion to the 
corpus. There are, however, a couple of chapters of a previous series (chapters 
5 and 6 of "復興!? 異種交配―魔族と人間の共生時代―") which include a girl with a
dick... not really what I'm talking about here, tho.
{:.no-indent}

I, Chloe, find this unlikely but am still hopeful.
{:.no-indent}

_Since initially writing these notes, the author has posted fan art of a VTuber 
on Twitter, which depicts a femboy getting fucked by tentacles. Similarly, the 
author has also recently posted about another popular work about a femboy 
getting tentacled._

## Outro

It's good, 10/10 on both the hentai and the general manga scale. Good work, 
Okunoha, you did it, please make more chapters. Follow us on things, see you 
next week! ***FUCK ME, SHOGO!***
