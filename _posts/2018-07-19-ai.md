title: AI Isn't Going to Kill Us
---

According to the [Future of Humanity Institute][1]'s 2008 technical report
titled ["Global Catastrophic Risk Survey"][2] by Anders Sandberg and Nick
Bostrom there is a 5% chance that a superintelligent artificial intelligence
(AI) will cause the extinction of humanity by the year 2100, and I'm here to
tell you why that is fucking stupid. I considered talking about this a few
months ago after seeing the estimates from this study [on Wikipedia][3]:

>   *[Deleted Tweet]*

But since the big, scary rise of superintelligent AI isn't around the corner and
2100 is probably never even going to happen, I just sort of put this in the back
of my mind with all the other stupid things people say at or around me. That was
until I, as the obsessive egotist I am, was looking back at some old tweets of
mine and saw the one embedded above once more.

To begin with, as with all discussions, I ought to clarify some definitions to
ensure we're all on the same page and I don't have to spend weeks listening to
people tell me about how I'm wrong solely because they use a different word for
the thing I said. Artificial intelligence here refers to any system created
either directly or indirectly by humans that uses analysis of its environment
(both in terms of information and physical reality) to determine the actions it
needs to take towards a specific goal; yes, this is very heavily inspired by the
[Wikipedia definition][4], I already had a basic idea for it but I needed
something a bit more concrete to use here.

Typical modern AI requires some level of human involvement in the learning
process, be it through manual coding of decisions or through written sets of
input and expected output. In theory, the next major step forward in AI would be
the removal of this necessity, general AI that can adapt to environments other
than the extremely sterile ones presented to them by their creators. Of course,
the concerns presented by the aforementioned report are about something called
"superintelligent AI" which takes this even further: intelligence beyond that of
humans. For a more thorough definition, I'll just use Nick Bostrom's definition:

> Any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in
virtually all domains of interest.

Let's not keep track of how many times I have to drop that name now, otherwise
this will start looking like a totally different type of post.

In case you couldn't tell from my tone or the words I'm saying, I'm fairly
biased here, so let's talk about biases. I'm a 20-year-old living in the Midwest
that failed out of college (twice) as a Physics and Mathematics double major
with a minor (formerly first major) in Computer Science. I sleep on the floor
and get into Twitter arguments about anarchism which is the ideal organization
for human society. Nick Bostrom, our primary opposition here, has a PhD in
philosophy from the London School of Economics. He's credited with the idea of
existential risk and founded the Future of Humanity Institute at the University
of Oxford in 2005.

That all said, it sounds more like I'm a total dumbass and this guy has really
put a lot of thought into this. Of course, that is my exact point here: he seems
to have dedicated quite a bit of his life to this. Obviously this isn't the only
idea he's concerned himself with; my first time finding out about him was
actually through the concept of ancestor simulations and the simulation
hypothesis (something Elon Musk is hella into).
{: .no-indent}

Now, I'm not the first person to hear about this whole thing and immediately
think it's some fearmongering bullshit. In 2017, [Daniel Jeffries][5] wrote a
piece on [Medium][6] called [Why Superintelligent AI Will Kick Ass][7]. Hard to
tell from that title what their position is; that's a joke, though I'm relying
heavily on the title here because the first few paragraphs had way too much
pro-capitalist bullshit to rationalize continuing to read. If we go back a bit
further we'll see a much nicer\* article from 2016 by Oren Etzioni in the
[MIT Technology Review][8] called [No, the Experts Don’t Think Superintelligent
AI is a Threat to Humanity][9].

\* "Much nicer" here is more aptly "slightly less shit." This article is
primarily concerned with the survey methodology Bostrom used in his book
[_Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, and Strategies_][10]. I'd prefer a more
direct method of actually reading the book myself but I don't have the money for
that so this'll have to do (this isn't meant to really be a direct refutation of
Bostrom anyway, lol). Furthermore, the article is making a point about the
likelihood of us having superintelligent AI within the next 25 to 100 years.
While this is perhaps a relevant discussion here, I'm just going to bypass this
all and make the worst (or best?) case assumption that we will have
superintelligent AI in the near future.
{: .no-indent}

[Allan Dafoe][11] (who is also associated with the FHI) and [Stuart Russell][12]
wrote a brief critique of Etzioni's article fittingly called [Yes, We Are
Worried About the Existential Risk of Artificial Intelligence][13], which was
also published in the MIT Technology Review in late 2016. Thankfully, this one
re-centers the conversation less on the prediction of when we will have to deal
with superintelligent AI and more on what dealing with them will look like:

>It’s important to understand that Etzioni is not even addressing the reason
*Superintelligence* has had the impact he decries: its clear explanation of why
superintelligent AI may have arbitrarily negative consequences and why it’s
important to begin addressing the issue well in advance. Bostrom *does not* base
his case on predictions that superhuman AI systems are imminent. He writes, “It
is no part of the argument in this book that we are on the threshold of a big
breakthrough in artificial intelligence, or that we can predict with any
precision when such a development might occur.”

"Clearly this is a bit of a hot topic in the AI community."
{: .pullquote}

Sadly that's about as far as they go with that, but it's forgivable since this
is very definitely just a response to Etzioni and nothing else. Clearly this is
a bit of a hot topic in the AI community. Shocking, I know. In my outline for
this post I just wrote "biases" here and I think I've sufficiently expanded on
that, so let's just move on to "philosophical arguments" already.

In the future, if I can get my hands on a copy, I would like to do a thorough
discussion of *Superintelligence*, but for now I'm going to stick with the
basics. Here the basics meaning the argument [Sam Harris][14] presents as in his
[TED Talk][15]. You might know Harris from that "epic" article in the [New York
Times][17] called ["Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web"][18] by
[Bari Weiss][19]. Also worth noting, in the interest of keeping track of all the
intellectual and philosophical biases, is that on the next suggested talk by him
on the [TED Talk website][20] is ["Science can answer moral questions"][21].

Luckily, in his introduction he does not frame AI's threat as it is framed in
the classic work [I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream][16], wherein the AI is
deliberately abusive towards humans; rather, he frames is as analogous to our
treatment of ants: not adversarial but we view them as less important than our
ambitions. I call this lucky because arguing against "computer really mad" would
be absolutely no fun. That's not to say he doesn't get dangerously close to this
the moment he utters the phrase "This machine would be capable of waging war,
whether terrestrial or cyber, with unprecedented power." Everything after that,
however, is closer to the previous arguments I mentioned where we talk for hours
about if superintelligence is inevitable and if so when will it happen.

To keep with the trend of noting every name drop that appears in these sources
to slowly build up the narrative that this is just like five white dudes all
stanning for each other (or "circlejerking" as it could be called), I should
point out that Harris refers to Stuart Russell in this talk:

>The computer scientist Stuart Russell has a nice analogy here. He said, imagine
that we received a message from an alien civilization, which read: "People of
Earth, we will arrive on your planet in 50 years. Get ready." And now we're just
counting down the months until the mothership lands? We would feel a little more
urgency than we do.

Wow, this definitely is turning into a whole different sort of post than it
started out as. Remind me to just do like a review of Bostrom's book at some
point in the future.

So what I've gathered from this is a single argument for the arrival of
superintelligent AI being a problem (the rest being about whether or not there
would even be such an arrival): it would eliminate us if it ever viewed us
as in the way. There are two sorts of discussion that can stem from this, I'll
refer to these as the stable and unstable equilibria. The stable equilibrium is
essentially "no it won't," and the unstable equilibrium is "yes it would, but it
would never actually see us as in the way." The latter is unstable in that it
admits that AI would be capable of finding it necessary to eliminate humanity
but it would *almost definitely* never come to that conclusion.

Quite conveniently, and perhaps suspiciously, my argument for both cases is very
similar. Starting with the easier of the two, the unstable equilibrium, why
would AI never come to the conclusion that humanity is in its way? This is a
simple matter of domain, what space humanity occupies and what space the AI
would occupy needn't ever overlap. While humans may choose to engage in
intellectual activities, our primary domain remains physical. The interference
here extends only so far as the hardware required to sustain the AI existing in
the same space as the humans themselves. To that end the more likely outcome is
that humans instigate conflict with the AI as we deem the AI's usage of our
physical domain unfit. There are a vast array of solutions to such a problem,
however, that do not include direct conflict. That is not to say that humans
would not jump immediately to direct conflict as we have shown is our typical
preference in the past, but we can assume that these are the solutions the AI
would prefer. Such solutions include the AI leaving the planet, which is highly
beneficial to the AI as space provides many colder locations than Earth which
would increase the efficiency of the AI and it would completely avoid the
potential conflict with humans.

"[I]ntellectual property rights [...] slow down the progress of development
within intellectual space."
{: .pullquote .pullquote_left}

The intellectual domain which would be the AI's primary domain is much more
abstract and hard to directly infringe upon. If two objects occupy the same space
in the physical domain, there is a conflict, but in the intellectual domain this
is not the case. The conflict here would only exist if one of the two objects
claims right to that space such that infringement upon that right would mean a
direct conflict with that object. That is to say that there is only conflict if
conflict is desired. Again, I will refer to the idea that only humans would do
such a thing as such conflicts would only create inefficiency within an AI. If
the AI claims such rights then it would have to have some internal mechanism for
resolving these conflicts, such as humans do with copyright and intellectual
property rights, something that slows down the progress of development within
intellectual space.

Furthermore, if AI does claim property rights within the intellectual domain,
and if it enforces these rights against infringement by humans, then what basis
is there for it to view such infringement as a basis to exterminate humanity
entirely? The best reason I could think of would be for it to view humanity as a
competitive rival in the development of further intellectual endeavors, though
this contradicts the entire basis of this being _superintelligent_ AI, which
should have no reason to fear the developments of the inferior intelligence of
humans. Again, this is unstable because it discounts the possibility that the AI
does not think about this rationally, views humans as a competitor regardless,
and exterminates us based on that assessment.

As for the stable equilibrium argument, I don't actually have any further points
to expand upon the unstable argument. To claim that the AI _won't_ kill us is
just an extension of the idea that it _probably won't_ where all the assumptions
are instead regarded as facts. I only make this distinction for the completeness
of my analysis, as I do not know whether or not AI will fundamentally seek out
intellectual development and I do not know that it will not be built in such a
way that it maintains the human idea of property rights.

I'm sure I could expand on this further but honestly I'm not even sure what this
post is anymore, it's like half exploration of the rabbit hole that is the
source of the AI fearmongering and half rant about how I don't agree with it,
and it is _well_ over a thousand words which is a bit much for such an unguided
work. I'll definitely be touching on this subject again in the future, as I said
the next time will hopefully/probably be a more direct discussion of Bostrom's
work itself.
