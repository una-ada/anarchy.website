## Preface

I made this font while sad about not getting tacos, and so it's called "No
Tacos :(" or just "Nota" for short. The approach here is to simply not put in
too much effort, because, to be honest, I'm just really not feeling it today.
On the other hand, I did need a title font to match with my previous font, Una
Script. So, what's going to happen here is a very low effort, high contrast,
serif font.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

Actually, low effort is kind of the name of the game as far as the Una fonts
go. Una Script was intended to be cutesy, but that was really just a convenient
result of the fact that people generally consider my handwriting to be so
already. Here I will be aiming for something along the lines of trying to write
a fancy title in your notes at school (I have done this before, I don't know
about anyone else). This effectively means a lot of straight lines done with a
straight edge, but without a constant angle or any sort of template; all of the
curves and even some of the lines will simply be done via eyeballing.

Rather than simply calling this font "Nota," it will be called "Una Nota," to
avoid confusion with existing fonts and to denote its inclusion in the Una font
family.

## I. _Design_
{:#i}

The initial design was done in my notebook[^1] with some quick pencil[^2]
sketches and then outlining and filling done in pen.[^3] Each glyph was drawn
as nearly two lines tall, the riser line being drawn in with a straight edge
without any measurement. Because the line guideline between the two lines in
which the glyph was drawn was already present, it was used as the x-height; and
given that the ascender line was drawn below the existing guideline on top of
the line, the x-height here can be considered rather high. Regardless, this was
approached as a Didone font, but no references were used.

[^2]:   Uni-ball Shift Pipe Lock Drafting Pencil, 0.5mm

[^3]:   Uni Pin Fineliner, 0.1mm, Blue

Onto the more elemental details. Serifs were inconsistently added, mostly
hairline serifs with some attempt to make a few appear like transitional or
wedge serifs.[^4] Similarly, terminals were added wherever sort of felt right
at the time. Positioning of tittles was given no thought. The stems are
incredibly inconsistent as nothing was used to measure them, same for the
angles of the arms. All the apexes are flat, whatever. Apertures were guessed,
i.e. eyeballed, and counters were drawn in with (what I would like to consider)
a delicate touch and prayer to the typographical gods for however little favor
they have left for me.

[^4]:   The "or" here is not to be read as to imply different styles were
        intended so much as I have no fucking clue how to classify what I did
        here.

For stylistic consistency, all filled sections were done with sloppy hatching,
though a few show a bit more effort than others. The resulting designs can be
seen here:

With this image in mind, let's discuss some specific glyphs. We'll just go
through some notable ones in the order they appear here, which is (hilariously)
not the proper order for an ASCII table or the appropriate Unicode table.

-   "**F**" reaches over way too far, lmao.
-   "**G**" has a terrible beard, designed like a serif by someone who forgot
    what a serif looks like.
-   "**P**" has a stem that was completely off vertical and later attempts to
    correct it did not help.
-   "**Q**" is supposed to have a tail... I suppose that counts.
-   "**R**" is a failure. Massive fuck up. I'm not going to fix it.
-   "**W**" is probably my favorite in this whole set, it is my child and I
    will defend it.
-   "**d**" has an incomplete stem.
-   "**f**" looks more like a long s (ſ) because I drew the terminal without    
    thinking about the spacing necessary for the crossbar.
-   "**g**" is single-story and this is a stylistic choice not simply due to my
    ineptitude and laziness.
-   "**j**"'s descender goes too far left but "yolo."
-   "**u**" and "**x**" are simply the results of terrible planning, or lack
    thereof.
-   "**y**" is absolutely horrendous, it sucks, I hate it, kill me.
-   "**3**" was a mistake. I don't know what happened there, I guess I tried to
    go for, like, and oldstyle "3" but as a lining digit and...?

That's enough self-deprecation, though. Overall, I think the style works as
intended. In the words of my girlfriend, the emotion conveyed here is like "I'm
going to punch a hole in my wall while listening to Green Day because my mom
won't take me to Taco Bell."

## II. _Vectorization_
{:#ii}

Making usable vectors from a thrown together sketch in a notebook is a process
that one could potentially take very seriously. As with Una Script, I will not
be doing that. Not only did I once again not bother to scan the paper despite
access to the proper equipment, I didn't even trace the vectors by hand this
time. Before any of that, I had to take the picture (from the previous section)
and get it into a bit more of a readable format, specifically getting it as
high contrast as possible. Here I used Photoshop, first applying some cropping
and then attempting to use the perspective crop feature to get it more flat
since the page was pretty warped and also just general distortion from taking a
picture. Then it was on to the Camera Raw filter, because I like having
everything in one place. Typical adjustments to exposure, contrast, tweaking
highlights and shadows, and some attempts at trying to use the dehaze filters
and such to get a clearer image. This resulted in the following image:

At that point I could then drag it into Illustrator and apply a trace. This is,
of course, a decently complicated procedure as there are many adjustments to
make and each requires a complete reload of the filter that takes forever
because my laptop is dying (please send me money so I can buy a new laptop).
Finally each glyph was resized in a new document with guidelines for the em-
square: ascender/cap, baseline, and descender, all based on the "**P**" and
"**g**" glyphs. Some glyphs, such as "**:**" and "**=**," were built using
copies of glyphs that were similar to their parts, because I did not draw those
in the draft.

This time around, I ensured each glyph was in its own layer, and each layer was
named after the appropriate Unicode character in camel case. With that all done
from the start, as well as the fact that everything was already traced as
filled objects, exporting was a simple matter of running the layer export
script.

## III. _Building_
{:#iii}

And here we are, finally building the font as a font. I didn't put much effort
into this, simply imported all the glyphs, ran some automated fixes (rounding
control points to integer, adding extrema, fixing direction, &c.), and ignored
a bunch of other errors. Hinting was all automated. Also didn't bother
adjusting the ascender and descender heights in the font info. The most effort
that was put into any of this was the kerning (because of course it was),
specifically with "**F**" and "**f**." The "**j**" glyph was a low effort
negative spacing on the left so I didn't have to put in all the effort to make
a whole bunch of custom classing just for one single glyph.
