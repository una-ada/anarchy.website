title: Magic Script I
---

These past few years, I've been doing some world-building for a number of 
novels I wish to write. As these stories ought to exist in the same world but 
during different eras, I need the setting to be fairly robust. Not wanting to 
feed my tendency to get bogged down with details, I decided to primarily lean 
on existing geography and language to provide the foundation for everything 
else. Of course, it is preferable in fiction to provide some semblance of our 
shared reality as a foothold for the reader's understanding, but it is also 
rather boring at times from a development perspective.

Today's focus is, of course, on language, so I'll skip any ramblings I might 
have outside of that as much as possible, but check out Fig. 1 for how the 
map's been going at least. For my own convenience, the Østendūn Imperium in 
which my plots are set is linguistically Germanic. Throughout its many 
territories, the languages spoken range from
[Gutnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutnish) to
[Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language),
[Elfdalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96vdalian) to
[Bavarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_language), all unified under 
a single Imperium with a single script. That script, following the conventions 
I believe to exist in many
[*Narōkei*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8D%E3%81%86%E7%B3%BB)
fantasy works, is essentially Latin with some light cryptographic stylization:

> Ꞃꞃρ Ꞅꞅ Ʃſʃ Ꞇꞇ Ccς Ʒʒ Vu Yɥ Ꝼꝼ Øω Ꝿջ

I've been keeping a document, the Cyclopædia, of my work on this world, and 
since it's focused on Østendūna, everything includes transliterations into this 
script. However, there must be other scripts for it to be a more complete 
world, so I've mostly just repurposing existing scripts to various languages;
e.g. [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language) written in 
Oesol (Deconstructed [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)),
[Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) (replacing all 
*kanji* with their [*kun'yomi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kun%27yomi)) in 
[Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_script), and
[Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language) in
[Thaana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaana).
{:.no-indent}

This came to a head when I decided to work on a language for magic. See, south 
of Østendūna is Lilhia, a desert region which speaks
[Tangut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangut_language) (following my previous 
idea for a Latin-like script, I went with the obvious choice for a Chinese-like 
script here). Inspired in some part by Zoroastrianism's
[Avestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan), I wanted a distinct 
liturgical language for the region which, inspired by the form of Akkadian 
incantations, would also be used to construct prayers that serve as spells 
which borrow power from my world's Wyrms, i.e. gods. For the writing system, I 
went with another script similar to Chinese:
[Nüshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCshu). The vocabulary was then was 
chosen, for my own accessibility, to be
[Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona), which clashes quite a bit 
phonemically with the
[Xiangnan Tuhua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangnan_Tuhua) dialect for 
which Nüshu was designed. This resulted in the making of a great many 
spreadsheets, as at this point writing things out in Scrivener was no longer 
feasible due to the size of the tables. After all, I had opted to simply match 
the Pona with *hanzi* of similar meaning, which were then matched to the Nüshu 
meant to transliterate them, resulting in a significant number of homophones 
distinguished *at most* by slight tonal differences that are beyond the ability 
of my Anglophonic mouth. For exampled, *seme* > 何 (*hé*) > 𛇮
(*fu<sup>42</sup>*) and *ona* > 夫 (fú) > 𛆔 (*fu<sup>44</sup>*). Remapping the 
resulting Nüshu onto an entirely new phonology (e.g. *ha* and *fu* respectively 
for the previous examples) resulted in yet another spreadsheet, and at that 
point I was all in on just making spreadsheets for all my linguistic endeavors.

Now, obviously, given all this remapping, mixing, and matching I've been doing 
with scripts, I decided to make such endeavors easier should I desire to do so 
again in the future. This resulted in the very normal pastime of sorting every 
Unicode encoded glyph from an alphabet, abugida, and abjad I could find into a 
spreadsheet sorted by phoneme which I've thus dubbed
"[comparative orthography](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQWDCQfLXmxPZXN_kn4ANHLvh-KHWeqwpPprafwMuIEkDRWF5IdZ0eL0SBAbIPwhqT2ndyrvgbA81Zb/pubhtml)." 
{:.no-indent}

Data entry is mind-numbing work in general, but obsessing over something 
inevitably teaches you something, right? At the very least, this kicked the 
slumbering cat in my brain that thinks that I should just make my own things 
sometimes. Atop that, there was a discussion with my friend Mea regarding that 
aformentioned magic language, Liturgical Lilhian as I call it. She had 
mentioned all sorts of cool visuals one associates with magic runes and 
scripts, floating letters when spoken aloud and such, but despite that being an 
excellent option for aesthetics, it doesn't work with the world-building. 
Liturgical Lilhian is meant to be just one of many languages use for borrowing 
power from Wyrms, a fairly obscure one used only by the most dedicated of nerds 
who value efficiency and obscurity to such an extent they'd likely want to 
avoid visual flare (think Rust but for magic). The conclusion here is that I 
should just make a language with more flare! As a change of pace, I decided I 
would actually put in the work for a conlang here, which is something of a 
small undertaking.

## I. *Phonology*

So, new language, I have to decide on phonoloy, morphology, grammar, and 
orthography. As for morphology and grammar, let's just copy Hungarian! Well, 
I'm torn between Uralic and Semitic for morphology, and for grammar I 
definitely want six grammatical genders to match the six elements of magic in 
this world: aether, air, earth, fire, metal/stone, and water. That's all a 
problem for later, however, the most important decision is obviously the 
phonology. How about
[Hmong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_language#Phonology) with a bit of 
[Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology)? That 
might seem a bit crazy as an English speaker, but I can always pare it down 
later if need be. I mean, I'm from the Midwest, certainly I've picked up the 
ability to at least pronounce Hmong phonemes via osmosis at some point, right? 
So, for consonants, I get this chart:

||Labial|Dental|Alveolar|Retroflex|Palatal|Velar|Glottal|
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

That's certainly a lot of IPA symbols that the average reader wouldn't 
recognize; not to worry, though, you can simply ask Wikipedia about them! I'll 
get around to doing vowels later, for now we're moving on with orthography.
{:.no-indent}

## II. *Orthography*

My idea for how to approach the orthography was, because I'm like this, rather 
Chinese. Well, it's fairly international, actually. First, draw something 
pictographs, à la
[hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs) or Shang 
[bronzeware inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_bronze_inscriptions).
In my case, I decided the characters would be onomatopoeic in nature, thus the 
pictographs would represent the source of the sound, e.g. a cat for /m/, snake 
for /s/, or bee for /z/. The key is balancing the right level of detail; I was 
really inspired by the inscription which developed into
[龍](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BE%8D#Chinese) (*lóng*) as I drew these 
(I mean, look at that little hat).

Next is the process of turning pictographs into graphemes. You can compare this 
to the development of
[Egyptian untiliteral signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Uniliteral_signs)
into [Proto-Sinaitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script) then 
[Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet), or bronze 
insciptions into
[oracle bone script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script) then 
[seal script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script). It's basically 
abstraction, trying to draw the same thing but in fewer strokes and less time 
(see Fig. 3). This is also where medium starts to really affect the script, my 
medium of choice here being the whiteboard my wife gifted me for Christmas last 
year. Regardless of this questionably ahistorical choice, I trudged onward 
until I had covered my entire consonant inventory.[^2]

{:.figure}

**Figure 3.** Examples of my approach to glyph design.
{:.figure}

As evidenced by Fig. 3, the graphemes I've created ar rather... loopy. My wife 
provided feedback throughout this process, and that loopiness was one aspect 
she brought up as a potential issue for realism (I know for a fact that she 
only learned of [Glagolitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_script) 
recently). In the moment, it felt right to draw the characters like this, in 
part because of the medium I was drawing upon. I did try other methods of 
abstraction, such as a more Chinese approach of top-down strokes, crosses, and 
boxes which I simply didn't vibe with at the time. Of course, I can and will 
justify anything that I like in the world-building, so that's what I've done 
here. See, this is a script for *magic*, not just any old writing system. Would 
it be carved into stone like Phoenician? No! It would be drawn onto skin with 
blood, onto stone with chalk, or into the air with pure energy. Therefore! The 
loopiness is acceptable... nay, preferable! Yes, preferable. Moving on.
{:.no-indent}

## III. *Miniscule*

Should this script be bicameral? It is my opinion that miniscule scripts are a 
wholly European idiosyncracy, and thus not the best to mirror in constructed 
languages. Regardless, aesthetics trump realism, so the question is instead 
whether it would improve anything. My wife's advice was to do what looked most 
natural, starting by writing out samples with the current inventory. I, of 
course, already know how to develop a realistic miniscule and thus immediately 
set to comparing the two.

So, how does one create a miniscule? Let's ignore some of the boring examples 
such as [Deseret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_alphabet), where 
miniscule only exists to mirror the form of Latin typography and thus is a mere 
downscaling of the majuscule. Miniscule in Latin derives from
[Carolingian miniscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule), 
which in turn came from [uncial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script) (possibly itself derived from
[Roman cursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive)).
[Greek miniscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_minuscule) as well 
derives from uncial via cursive; the clearest example of this is Ξ > ξ. What we 
can learn from this is that a miniscule is best created from a righting of 
cursive script; first, write the original script in as few strokes as is 
reasonable, then normalize the results to match up to the form of the 
majuscule. Figure 4 shows the first step of this process, though with clear 
intentionality for the later step.

{:.figure}

{:.figure}

This miniscule was said to feel more realistic than the majuscule, though I 
would argue that it simply appears more akin to Latin. If anything, I'd say we 
moved from BCE to CE with this, but that's entirely based on my handwriting. 
What's needed is more clear reference form, and for that we move on to 
digitization.
{:.no-indent}

## IV. *Digitization*

When it comes to digitization, I could simply do as I did with
[Una Script](https://anarchy.website/2020/07/11/fonts.html) and merely 
vectorize my own handwriting; however, this wouldn't provide a reference form 
as desired. Instead, I ought to design a font that looks deliberate, fitting in 
with existing fonts but for another language.

**Figure 5.** Comparison between the original graphemes and the serif-font glyphs.
{:.pullquote .pullquote_left .pullquote_image}

Since I use Google's Noto fonts for copy these days, I figured I'd design this 
new font to match. This lead to the subsequent decision of whether to base it 
on [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) or
[Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif). I do tend to 
prefer serif (or modulated) fonts, so this was an easy choice for me. I'm 
pretty sure the
[OFL](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-fonts/blob/main/LICENSE) allows for 
mushing the pieces of a font together to make a new one, as long as I credit 
the original. Given that I haven't exactly published any of the font itself 
yet, consider this your advance credit.
{:.no-indent}

The design of the glyphs could definitely be seen as another layer of 
abstraction, as I aimed to recreate the general strokes with existing elements 
of Noto Serif. An unbelievable amount were some sort of '8' and 'n' chimera, 
but many needed elements not found in Latin. For those cases,
[Noto Serif Armenian](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+Armenian) (e.g. ՈՑշջ)[^3]
and [Noto Serif Georgian](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+Georgian) (e.g. ᲒᲨჩⴌᲴᲰთჳⴗⴘⴤ)
were used instead.
{:.no-indent}

In some cases, I basically outright copied a glyph, which runs into another 
thing my wife mentioned before: if people think they know how to read it 
they'll read it wrong. There's not much I can *really* do about that at this 
point! The /g/ looks like a 'p,' the /s/ looks like an 'h.' Some letters are 
copies of Armenian or Georgian letters, so I doubt the average English speaker 
will be too confident on an incorrect reading, but I'm just going to have to 
not care about that. I would love for the whole thing to look completely alien, 
but that isn't possible when I'm putting together pieces of existing scripts.
{:.no-indent}

You might notice that this process has killed a bit of the flare in the 
miniscule/cursive script. While completely intentional for the sake of 
consistent appearance among other scripts, it is a bit of a shame. As a 
compromise, I could make italic (oblique) glyphs that follow the cursive more 
closely, cf. [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script). I could 
make use of the curl on 'ƪ' to recreate some of the flourish on ascenders. 
Regardless, this is an issue for the future.

Then comes the question: as a font, where should I encode the characters? 
Obviously, this is going in the Unicode
[Private Use Areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) (PUA),[^1] 
but where? I generally want to avoid overlapping with something like the 
[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative](https://mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi) (MUFI) and 
definitely want to avoid something I would actually use, like
[Oesol](https://github.com/Tzetachi/Computer-Modern-Unicode-Oesol). Thus, after 
much contemplation, I decided on going for `U+F700-F7FF` as it has minimal 
impact on MUFI.

Having the general block is good, but I also need to decide the exact ordering 
of the glyphs. This usually follows alphabetical order, but I haven't decided 
such a thing yet! My Illustrator artboards are organized to match their 
locations on the IPA chart. The exported files are sorted alphabetically by 
artboard name, but they're named things like "capital dz retroflex prenasal." I 
could sit here for days trying to decipher how Phoenician ended up in that 
order and how to recreate the process myself, but I'll just stick to my classic 
approach: sorted by Greek. It would probably make more sense to sort it like 
[Pahawh Hmong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahawh_Hmong) since the phonemes 
would line up better, or even
[Bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo) (though their orders are, of 
course, fairl comparable), but I didn't think of that!
{:.no-indent}

This also requires me to actually figure out the vowels, which I was *not* 
prepared for at all. I was just going to lean on
[Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_phonology) here: /i, iː, y, 
yː, u, uː, ɛ, eː, ø, øː, o, oː, ɒ, aː/, but got all indecisive and wanted to 
mix in my favorite strut vowel /ʌ/ and also /ɪ/. Then when I wrote them all out 
with those, I didn't pay attention to the contrasting long and short vowels, so 
there's also things like /e/ and /ɪː/. Plus, I decided to give four rows, or 64 
encoding slots, to both majuscule and miniscule, but miscounted the number of 
consonants and had to drop /ø, øː/ from the end. The result is a mess, but they 
can always be swapped around if need be, like removing /ɛː/ and putting /eː/ in 
its place. At least a decent number of slots are assigned to the 
yet-to-be-designed vowels, so I'm sure it will work out. With that, the 
tentative assignment chart looks like this:
{:.no-indent}

|      | 0 | 1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7 | 8 | 9 | a | b | c | d | e | f |
|-----:|---|----|---|---|---|---|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|U+f70x| a | aː | ʌ | ʌː| b |ⁿb | v  | g |ⁿg | ɣ | d |ⁿd | dz|ⁿdz| dʐ|ⁿdʐ|
|U+f71x|ɟ~ʥ|ⁿɟ~ʥ| ɛ | ɛː| z | ʐ | ʑ  | e | eː| θ | ð | j | i | iː| ɪ | ɪː|
|U+f72x| k | l  | l̥ | m | m̥ | n | n̥  | ŋ | o | oː| p | r | s | ʂ | ɕ | t |
|U+f73x| tʰ| ts |tsʰ|tʂʰ|tʂʰ|c~ʨ|c~ʨʰ| u | uː| y | yː| pʰ| f | kʰ| x | h |
{:.table_grammar .figure}

**Table 2.** Unicode assignments based on phoneme.
{:.figure}

This table repeats on rows U+f74x-f77x for the miniscule glyphs. There's no 
assignments for anything like punctuation yet, as that's another future concern.
{:.no-indent}

This is as far as I've come this week. There's a lot more that needs to be done 
just for the font alone: vowels, punctuation, kerning, italics. Then there's 
the whole language itself to work on. Along with that may come more 
modifications to the font, such as the inclusion of common ligatures. For now, 
however, I've got Chinese gender-bender yuri fantasy isekai webnovels to catch 
up on, so I'll leave you with this screenshot from FontForge:

## Footnotes

[^1]: The abbreviation 'PUA' is always funny to me as it gets used a lot in Chinese web novels as shorthand for manipulative behavior, from "pick-up artist."

[^2]: Admittedly, I got kind of bored and decided to start mapping the same starting pictograph to multiple phonemes by removing certain elements from the resulting abstraction for what I imagine to be the more common sounds. I imagine this because they are the sounds I can actually pronounce.

[^3]: Is it just me, or is Noto Serif Armenian a bit... off. Like the metrics are all slightly off from Noto Serif. On top of that, the serifs are smaller? It's weird.
