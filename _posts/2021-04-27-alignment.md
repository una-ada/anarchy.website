Hi, I'm Chloe... _and I'm Una..._

... and welcome to ~~Goth Angel Sinners~~ Chloe & Una's Tentacular Experience. A
weekly podcast with the hottest hentai reviews for all your betentacled[^1]
needs. In writing up these notes we have in fact discovered that "betentacled"
is a real word and _will_ be using it every chance we get.

Basically, every week we are going to read and/or watch a new hentai and give
you, our wonderful listeners a plot summary, our thoughts and review, some
information on adaptations if any, and important cultural information relevant
to the hentai so you too can be an expert on all things hentai. Also any time
one of us learns about a new fetish we didn't realize we had, we will be
playing this sound [sound].

## I. _Background_
{:#i}

_Hentai_ is a Japanese word literally meaning "strange condition," however it
is often used as shorthand for the phrase "_hentai seiyoku_," meaning an
"abnormal sexual desire," used in the context of psychology to describe
paraphilias. In Japanese the term is used to mean "pervert" or "perverted",
however in English and for our purposes here, it is used to refer to erotic
comics, cartoons, and games from Japan. Some terms used in Japan for these are
_eromanga_, _eroanime_, and _eroge_.

_Ecchi_ is a term used in Japanese to describe playfully sexual things, in
terms of media it will refer to things which are not pornographic but rather
hinting at it. Softcore as opposed to hardcore; tongue-in-cheek as opposed to
tongue-in-asshole. Its origins are in the Japanese pronunciation of the English
letter H, the first letter in hentai.
{:.content__p_noindent}

_Doujinshi_ are self-published works, comics, zines, fanfiction, etc. They are
not necessarily sexual, but much like Western "fanfiction" they very well can
be and often the term will carry that connotation.
{:.content__p_noindent}

_Toire no Hanako-san_ is a Japanese urban legend/modern urban folklore wherein
a girl haunts a bathroom stall (for whatever reason).[^2] Typically the third
stall of a bathroom on the third floor of a school and summoned by knocking on
the door three times. In some cases, this ghost is a benevolent spirit who may
grant wishes to those who summon them, i.e. this case with the fucking and
stuff.

## II. _Manga_
{:#ii}

### II-1. Characters
{:#ii-1}

-   Takahashi Naoko (高橋尚子)
-   Sakurako (櫻子)
-   Oohara Seita<sup>?</sup> (大原正太)
-   Ooshiro (大城)
-   Maruyama Yuuko (丸山裕子)
-   Tsubakiko (椿子)

### II-2. Summary
{:#ii-2}

The manga opens with a few full-color pages of a scene by the pool that happens
between Sakurako and Takahashi. In the anime this scene is shown
chronologically rather than as a preface, and features Oohara's stolen dick
rather than a double-ended dildo.

#### II-2.1 Chapter 1
We begin with a scene of Takahashi masturbating in class begging to be looked
at by her classmates who don't seem to notice her presence, especially the boy
behind her who she has a crush on, Oohara. After cumming she realizes she's
actually dead and her feelings were mutual. She then meets Sakurako, a _Toire
no Hanako-san_ who wears a maid dress. She uses her powers to allow Takahashi
to fuck Oohara, by which we mean she kills him and the rest of their class too
because that's the only way a ghost could fuck a human.

#### II-2.2 Chapter 2
This chapter shows Takahashi, Oohara, and Sakurako having a threesome, and
Sakurako being a fucking cumslut about it, but they are interrupted by a femboy.

#### II-2.3 Chapter 3
The femboy is Ooshiro, a boy from their class with a crush on someone who can't
confess to them due to being a ghost. Sakurako revives him so he can do that
but revives him as a girl and steals his dick and proceeds to fuck "him" with
it. Afterwards they see him fucking a dude and they say "so you were a homo all
along, huh?"

#### II-2.4 Chapter 4
In chapter 4 we meet Maruyama-sensei and also a picture of Sakurako's foot
covered in cum. Maruyama-sensei is incredibly strict, especially about public
displays of affection, specifically because she was dumped by her boyfriend
after he came out as gay and was seen fucking Ooshiro at the end of the
previous chapter.

#### II-2.4 Chapter 5
In chapter 5 it is revealed that Sakurako's hair that we've seen thus far is a
wig and her actual hair is shorter and black, also her outfit is different and
more stereotypical of the "_Toire no Hanako-san_." Anyway, she threatens to
kill Takahashi again for seeing her like this, but instead Takahashi steals
Oohara's dick and fucks her with it. There's a funny bit where she says "I
promise I won't shove it into your pussy so suddenly" and then immediately
shoves it in her ass. "It's spraying out... My cum enema... Is spraying out..."

#### II-2.6 Chapter 6
In this chapter a second _Hanako-san+, Tsubakiko, appears and tricks Oohara
into giving her his dick and also just kinda yeets him out of existence, then
she finds Sakurako and uses tentacles to bind her and fuck her. Takahashi then
takes control of Tsubakiko's body and makes her cum in Sakurako a whole bunch
and finds her remains in Tsubakiko's body and comes back to life using them.

#### II-2.7 Chapter 7
A bunch of girls then publicly humiliate Takahashi as revenge for getting to
come back to life and threaten to take her new-found virginity which she says
she wanted to give to Sakurako, but then it turns out it was all a set-up by
Sakurako to take her virginity and the two be gay and live happily ever after.

### II-3. References
{:#ii-3}

In the prologue, "Topical? Arc," there is what appears to be a Gundam in a
single panel, where Takahashi says "well, there are other things used in the
desert that might seem tropical in their own ways, too…" This may or may not be
the YMS-09D Dom Tropical Test Type, but I don't know anything about Gundams, so
nobody fact-check this, please; I do not need this hit to my fragile ego, I'm
already falling apart.

The recurring gay character throughout is "likely" a reference to the oft
parodied _Kuso Miso Technique_ by Yamakawa Junichi. While this bara manga is
referenced frequently enough that it can be considered more a meme than a
direct reference to the work, the opening pages are almost directly copied as
the final two pages of Chapter 5. The reference is further doubled down upon
with the frequent use of the phrase "ウホッ" by and around this character.

There's probably some reference with the 62nd Ghost Fight, but I'm not gonna
decipher that mess. Probably another Gundam thing, everything's a Gundam
reference.

## III. _Anime_
{:#iii}

### III-1. Changes
{:#iii-1}

Several scenes are omitted from the anime adaptation as well as the order being
changed. Chapters 2 and 7 are removed completely, and the order is changed such
that the scene order goes Chapter 1, 5, 4, 3, 6, as well as the "preface" bit
being included between 3 and 6.

Sakurako, Takahashi, and Oohara have a threesome in the manga,[^4] rather than
Takahashi immediately stealing Oohara's dick.

[^4]:   Page 49

Sakurako is a much bigger cumslut in the manga: "How many times have I told you
to let me drink it?"[^3]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^3]:   Page 60

When "reviving" Ooshiro, Sakurako does some folk dance thing in the anime, but
in the manga pukes up a large pile of human goop.[^5]

[^5]:   Page 67

The person to whom Ooshiro intended to confess is not revealed in the anime--as
they are described as "never being seen again" after getting fucked by
Sakurako--, but in the manga is revealed to be a man.[^6] "So you were a homo
all along, huh...?"
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^6]:   Page 80

Rather than punishing her for watching them fuck on the roof, they punish the
teacher for just being strict (and uptight, \*badumtiss\*).[^7] It is also
revealed that the reason why she's been particularly bad lately is that she was
dumped by her boyfriend, because he is gay (see: the guy fucking Ooshiro).[^8]

[^7]:   Page 86
[^8]:   Page 107

The bit when Sakurako is explaining why she prefers the look with the wig
changed from showing her having to fight off ghost hunters who don't see her as
a threat[^9] to a flashback that doesn't play with the words "wasn't that a
flashback just now" scrolling across the top of the screen. Also, she cuts
Takahashi in half after she calls her cute and Takahashi is behind her head??
so she looks long??? Please just watch it, lmao.

[^9]:   Page 114

Tsubakiko is hiding in the unnamed gay man when Oohara runs into her.[^10]
"Wanna fuck?"

[^10]:   Page 132

Tsubakiko is the one who killed Takahashi,[^11] and so Takahashi is able to
find her remains inside Tsubakiko and revive herself.[^12] An entire arc
wherein she is a living human again follows, which was entirely cut from the
adaptation. This includes a public humiliation scene, paralleling her initial
interactions with Sakurako.[^13] That scene is revealed to be a setup by
Sakurako[^14] immediately after Takahashi declares her love for the ghost.[^15]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^12]:   Page 159
[^13]:   Page 168
[^14]:   Page 182
[^15]:   Page 180

### III-2. Animation
{:#iii-2}

There are a lot of shots of cumming shown without the dick visible, not quite
an "x-ray" shot. Ghost shit. There's a lot of the typical showing thrusting by
just having part of the character fly in and out of view, very flashy stuff.

### III-3. Music
{:#iii-3}

The score during the opening scene are these melancholic, somewhat atonal,
pianos and synth pads which create a bittersweet atmosphere appropriate for a
ghost desperately wishing to overcome the isolation of being a disembodied
spirit, wishing only to be seen and to be loved. Truly a human story if one has
ever been told.

Theme song is '90s as fuck.
{:.content__p_noindent}

There's some spooky halloween-y themes when Sakurako is introduced because
she's mean and scary and also a ghost. The spooky themes continue during the
"sex ed" lesson, but take on a more romantic tone when Oohara and Takahashi
fuck.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The music is upbeat and jovial while they toy with the _sensei_ but gets a lot
more sinister when Sakurako appears.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The ending theme is just an instrumental version of the opening theme
{:.content__p_noindent}

Generally the music is appropriate, but kept minimal in terms of arrangement
and placement in the mix likely due to budgetary reasons as well as keeping
from overpowering the more important aspects of the video (the super hot sex
scenes).

## IV. _Conclusion_
{:#iv}

As an anime it's a 7/10, in terms of hentai it's an 8.5 maybe 9/10.
