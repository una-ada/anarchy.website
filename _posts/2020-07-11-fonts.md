## Preface

Theoretically, I have a site specifically for programming blogs and
documentation; issue with it is that it's just thrown together out of necessity
and hasn't really seen any maintenance in years. So, I figure I should do some
maintenance. I've been cleaning up a bunch of unused or otherwise unnecessary
files and code, but along the way I realized that I really ought to reconsider
the styling of it.
{: .content__p_dropcap}

My gut reaction was try to be all technical and monospace, but honestly? That
doesn't work for me anymore, just doesn't fit my personality. Now I'm working
with just the broad concept of "可愛い🌸." But _how_ do I even implement that?
I suppose starting with the font choice is a good way to go, as per the
original monospace idea, so I scrolled through some available fonts on Google
Fonts. Somehow, I did manage to get some inspiration there: handwriting fonts!
But they're all pretty mediocre; either too fancy to work as body text or too
mundane to justify... so... make my own?

## I. _How the fuck do you make a font?_

I've been reading some articles on this topic, and a lot of them seem to center
the process of design rather than the technical details. Their depth of
implementation is really just to direct you to some service... which is fine,
more or less, but a lot of these services are pretty mediocre in terms of their
range of features. Nonetheless, there's definitely a point about the design
process, let's do that.

First, the scope of the font, what do I want it to cover? Well, if it's
handwriting, it'll be my handwriting. This brings us to the obvious conclusion
that it should just include all the things I can write... well, most of them.
See, a while ago I posted a sample of my handwriting:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a fun little sample of my handwriting. 🤤 <a href="https://t.co/Lp1io115gM">pic.twitter.com/Lp1io115gM</a></p>&mdash; una, aspiring e-girl (@unaxiii) <a href="https://twitter.com/unaxiii/status/1251688363448557575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This covers Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Kana, and a little bit of Hangul. We'll cut
out the Hangul because it's incomplete and also I never write anything in
Korean anyway. Greek is only really relevant to mathematics, which is leads me
to a very annoying topic: $\LaTeX$.
{: .content__p_noindent}

See, even if I do manage to make a font, there's an issue with using it for
math rendering in that you can't simply say "use this font file," they're all
custom fonts from the developers of the library built in a specific way to work
with the library. This is a technical hurdle that we can address later, will
probably include an annoying amount of research and reverse engineering, but
I'm going to try to push through it somehow anyway. Is going off on tangents
bad? Who cares, I did find out that MathJax specifically at least has some
tools for generating the data necessary to make a font work with it [here][1].
Still going to be fun to try to figure out how to get things like integrals and
sigma notation to work out, not looking forward to it but definitely keeping it
in mind.

Anyway, back to the basic designs, a big question here is should I include
lowercase? I don't normally write in lowercase unless it's something like a
note to my coworkers... but on web it definitely looks better to have mixed
case than it does in a notebook. With that in mind, I think I'm going to go for
mixed case. The whole bit about cap heights and descender lines is sort of
irrelevant given that I am writing out the font by hand, lol, but also do need
to make some sort of consideration for how it will be implemented in the end, I
suppose.

That's enough trying to be a designer for now, I think. So back to the
technical[^1] details: should this be a raster font? I think in terms of
usability raster fonts are sort of a bad idea, but in terms of actually making
the thing it makes some sense. Well, it's not as if I can't vectorize my
handwriting... it just seems weird to do so? A silly excuse, this should be
vectors. So for now, I should just go ahead and try to write out every
character I need... so I need a list for that. I'm going to compile such a list
and come back to this after some sleep or some food, I think.

[^1]:   Every single fucking time I try to type "technical" I end up typing
        "technicaly" which isn't even "technically."

～ S L E E P ～ B R E A K ～
{:.content__p_centered}

So, I got very distracted, read some manga, messed around with some grammar
structuring, slept for a few hours, went to the store, really I forgot to
actually do the thing I said I was going to do. Well, let's focus and write out
a list of Unicode blocks to cover here:

 -  [Basic Latin][2]
 -  [Latin-1 Supplement][3]
 -  [Latin Extended-A][4]
 -  [Greek and Coptic][5]
 -  [Cyrillic][6]
 -  [General Punctuation][7]
 -  [Letterlike Symbols][8]
 -  [Number Forms][9]
 -  [Arrows][10]
 -  [Mathematical Operators][11]
 -  [Miscellaneous Technical][12]
 -  [Enclosed Alphanumerics][13]
 -  [Geometric Shapes][14]
 -  [Miscellaneous Symbols][15]
 -  [Hiragana][16]
 -  [Katakana][17]
 -  [_Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols_][18]?

I think that list should cover everything? It's a lot. There's more
mathematical operator and symbol blocks... I'll see if I need to deal with that
later, I suppose. For now, I'll just focus on the ones I know are necessary.
{: .content__p_noindent}

I'm just going to throw myself at this, really, write everything out on paper
and scan it later. From there I might just deal with the whole vectorizing in
Illustrator? Whatever tools seem to work the best, I guess.

You know what's really boring? Writing hundreds of letters on a page from a
list. It's mind numbing, it sucks, I don't have the patience for this. Should I
just put on some anime while doing this? Should I be doing this some other way?
Should I take shortcuts like using some prefab bits here and there? I've no
idea, maybe I should start with just a sample set to get the workflow down...
would really suck to put a ton of effort in only to decide to take a different
approach to the problem.

## II. _Just fucking get on with it._

I'm hesitating.

I know that I'm hesitating. I just need to do this. I've figured out most of
the workflow?
{: .content__p_noindent}

1.  Write out the glyphs.
2.  Scan the page.
3.  Trace glyphs in Illustrator.
4.  Save as SVGs.
5.  Import into FontForge.

This should work, I went with FontForge because it's free. Apparently when the
installer asks which language to use it's just asking for the installer. The
fucking thing installed in Japanese. Fine. This is fine. I don't like learning
new software like this, but fuck it at this point.
{: .content__p_noindent}

～ S L E E P ～ B R E A K ～
{:.content__p_centered}

Here's the thing, I have a scanner; well, access to a scanner. *However*, said
scanner is down to flights of stairs and I'd have to carry my laptop down there
and fiddle with the device settings and blah blah blah... So I just wrote out a
few blocks and took a picture with my phone. This is professional grade.
Industry standard. I've seen manga scans worse than this picture so I stand by
my statement. Going to get the picture onto my laptop by using the USB cable
for once, almost sent it to myself on Twitter, lmao.

Then, with a bit of adjustment in Photoshop (using Camera RAW Filter because
fuck you), I have this!
{: .content__p_noindent}

![][19]
{: .content__p_noindent}

So now I just drag this into Illustrator and run an image trace, obviously
fiddle with the settings a bit, and at this point just have a bunch of vector
objects... _but_, uh, what's the x-height here? Clearly it's my handwriting so
the ascender line and cap-height are the same, but do I really draw my
descenders so fucking long? Plus the quality of this is questionable at best,
have to do a lot of adjustments. I hate making adjustments, lol. Should I
really just draw them out with a tablet? Maybe, lol. Another idea: just use the
scan as reference and trace it by hand using the pen tool... might be the best
approach because then I can just adjust the stroke widths to account for
scaling whereas with this current method I would have to either live with the
strokes being inconsistent or deal with my natural size deviations. Really,
that's a stylistic choice and I'm not sure which direction to go with it...
{: .content__p_noindent}

Ok. After doing a whole bunch of other things (y'know spending some hours
drawing and having to fix the internet connection here) I've decided to go with
the pen tool route... which could take a few days, so I'm going to do it on and
off.

～ S L E E P ～ B R E A K ～
{:.content__p_centered}

Upon further consideration, maybe my ascender lines really are above my cap
height. I don't write in mixed case enough for this to really be something I
noticed, I guess. There are other considerations that I really just sort of
brushed aside here, like my handwriting is kind of contextual. My "I" looks
different if it's on its own than in a word, sometimes I write my periods as
little circles, sometimes I cross my zeroes, I rarely dot my "i"s... could make
adjustments for this sort of thing as I process the vectors, but still for now
I'm just keeping on keeping on.

～ M O V I N G ～ T O ～ S E A T T L E ～
{:.content__p_centered}

Bit of a pause in working on this on account of moving and such, hard to really
find the time and motivation to sit here resizing vectors during that. On the
topic of that resizing, as per some FontForge documentation regarding vector
inputs the SVGs should be 1000 by 1000 pixels. Pairing this with the need to
standardize the placing within the em square in relation to guidelines
(baseline, x-height, cap height, ascender line, and descender line), I've
started to process the traced vectors to such a format. Notably, the baseline
is above the center as the descenders are pretty long, I've considered
modifying this but have ultimately decided to stay true to form.

Some character have been modified more than others in terms of relative size,
especially among #, %, &, and so on, since they were originally drawn
significantly larger than regular text. My running principle with them is to
treat them as modifications of alphanumerics as much as possible, namely "&" is
drawn as a modified "E" and "\$" as "S".

## III. _What the hell am I doing?_

I've been sitting there, just fucking taking these glyphs one-by-one and
adjusting them to the guidelines. In that, trying to approximate the natural
deviation of my handwriting, since almost none of these actually follow such a
perfect alignment... but why? New strat: taking them in groups of four or five
and adjusting them together. This way I can get the relative deviations without
the group becoming too big to mess with.

Honestly, it would just look unnatural to force them onto the guidelines. At
best, I could stretch some of them, like my "W" would be way too wide if I just
scaled it to height, but I don't want to do that so I'm keeping the fact that
it doesn't touch the baseline.

With that done, I just need to expand the paths, clean up overlaps and... uh...
how the fuck do I get these into FontForge? It has instructions for [HAND CODED
SVGs][20] and _says_ there's the possibility of using Illustrator! What the
fuck! I'm looking up a solution, but every article is like "How To Design a
Font," like, bitch, I do not care. _How do I get these files into the thing!?!?_

Okay, not totally reading it right now but [this article from School of
Motion][21] mentions [this script for exporting][22].

>   The most useful glyphs to design (in this order) are:<br/>
    **& ? @ # $ % ! ( ) [ ] ; : ’ ’ ” ” , . - _ + =**<br/>
    _(Note: You'll need more if you want to make this emoji:_ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
    _)_[^2]

[^2]:   Praise be to this [gist][23]. But it would appear that the font I'm
        using on here doesn't show the overline as _over_ so much as a hyphen,
        womp womp.

This article just gets me, I think. I will be getting around to カタカナ
eventually, tho... eventually. Still, not what I care about. Anyway, for this
export script everything needs to be in layers... I originally did that, but
with these alignments I did them as objects in a single layer... I'm a dipshit.
So now I need to drag them all into their own layers. I named the layers by
their Unicode names, which is cool, but scrolling like ninety layers down while
dragging is a pin. Pro-tip: grab about half a screen height worth of objects
and put them in the layer for the first one so the rest can just be directly
dragged in to their appropriate layers. I'm genius now.
{: .content__p_noindent}

Well, with that done, I can just use the aforementioned script and get a nice
folder of SVGs... I missed tilde, but whatever. Since I'm _automating_ stuff
now, which is nice, I think I'm going to go off script from the School of
Motion tutorial at this point and make a namelist instead of importing the
glyphs one at a time, lol.

Of course, I would like to not have to type out the namelist, but I can't
fucking think so here I am. Oof.
{: .content__p_noindent}

New issue! I don't know how to use this program and my OS is set to Japanese so
the fucking thing automatically used Japanese localization! Found [a thing
about this][24], which references a [tutorial in French][25]. Cool. Luckily
found [another thing][26] which just says to edit a `.bat` file... which I just
accidentally deleted! I'm a fool! Atom doesn't have admin privileges to edit
it! Fuck! Ok, new plan, save it somewhere else and copy it in to overwrite the
original which should ask for admin approval which I will just push thru. Yay.
Now I can learn this thing~!!

Turns out the namelist doesn't do shit. Unless I'm using it wrong... ugh. Not
the worst, just manually imported each glyph. Whatever.

## IV. _Kerning!?!? Kerniiiiing!!!_

Fuck my life, lmao.

So, like, basically, what I did first was quickly adjust the positioning so the
glyphs weren't super far apart, then I thought "hey, there should be some
kerning here, how do I?" Turns out there's _a lot_ to that. See [documentation
thing][27].

What I'm going to do here is just manually kern every single pair. Why? Because
this is handwriting, it's not going to have consistent spacing, I'm just going
to space it out how it would look if I actually wrote it.

Along the way I've been experiencing a number of technical difficulties, namely
the crashes whenever I load too many kerning pairs, lol. That was probably a
RAM issue or something since it did not persist after closing Illustrator.
Tried following the tutorial more closely to try to avoid issues, but alas...
somehow I made things crash again. Well, no bother, I will deal with this all
at a later date.

～ S L E E P ～ B R E A K ～
{:.content__p_centered}

FUCK. THAT. This is totally unscalable, I need to do this more smarter, as in
actually do things by classes. Basically every single kern was a fairly large
negative number (like -20 or -150!!!), so this is a bearing issue. I set all
the bearings to 0 for now, going to go in an try to make them more
reasonable... maybe like ??? 20??? 10.

This fucking thing keeps corrupting when I add classes to kern!!! Fuck!!! This
sucks!!! Now I'm pushing every little update to the repo ;~;

## V. _Let's just finish this!_

I went thru and did all the kerning that came to mind, so I'm thinking I'm
going to call this good _for now_ with just Basic Latin. There's still a fair
bit more to do, but if I go thru it now then I'll know what I'm doing when I
start adding new characters.

First off, this was all thrown together in Illustrator so there's a lot of Non
Integral Points, i.e. control points that don't have integer coordinates. This
is supposedly not a huge deal but it can cause problems on some platforms so
I'm just spamming "fix" while it lists all the points. I can probably avoid
this in the future by fiddling with the SVG export settings, so I'll keep that
in mind! Actually, should probably just write out a precise guide on what I've
been doing here that's a bit less whiny, lol.

There's a whole bunch of tests and I'm not sure how relevant they _all_ are,
much of them are to do with rendering style, i.e. a perfectly vertical line
renders better than a nearly vertical one or points near the x-height should be
at the x-height for consistency. Stylistically, following every such guide
would kind of ruin this, so I'm ignoring most of them.

Running the full font validation to only see significant issues then, and
splines with extrema beyond their endpoint seems to be the theme here! Should
look into how to fix this ahead of time but again spamming fix, and of course
this means new points that aren't integers!! Why god?!?!?

Self intersecting points are pissing me off. There's definitely something about
it being easier to just do this at the SVG stage, since you can just read thru
the code and find any such things... as far as I know what makes a spline self
intersecting is that it begins and ends at the same point? This should be easy
to find in code, not so much in graphical editors. I'm assuming this problem
originates with the moving points to integers, so tiny little splines would be
reduce to two overlapping points, which again can be avoided early on. To fix
this, I'm going to actually go into the `.sfd` file and manually remove the
points, most of them don't appear to actually be control points, just `l 2`
whatever the hell that means. Ok, I lied, that was only in `}`. Angery.

Ignoring the validation checks _for now_ (lol). Just testing exports.
Initially, no kerning on Windows. None. Not even in Adobe products. So now I'm
messing with adding OpenType options and Windows-style kern to the export
settings. Using `.ttf` for now. The font preview in Windows is showing it all
good now, so I just need to export it as the other filetypes and I can start
messing with it in web design.

While reading up on trying to get a `.eot` file, I did find out you can round
all points to integers using the "Element" menu. Very cool. In any case, I'm
using [Fontie][28] to handle the conversions and such for now.

Oh, and since I haven't added quotes or anything yet, I have to turn off pretty
quotes in Kramdown for the site I'm testing this on! Cool!

New issue: heights. I don't know what I'm doing!!! I'm trying to adjust the
ascender and descender and none of this is working??? I know my descenders are
pretty long, but I can't seem to get the baseline in the right spot :/ Ok, so
I'll just adjust it all to be 500 and 500 then transform everything to match
the baseline, that seems to work just fine, yay me.

Anyway, the rest is just fiddling with the stylesheets, nothing to do with the
font. So, that's all! Good enough! I'm "done."
