A while back, I was reading Destiny Unchain Online—the
[web novel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/destiny-unchain-online-i-became-a-vampire-girl-and-eventually-became-known-as-the-demon-king-of-blood/),
of course, the
[manga](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/90fdtn0/destiny-unchain-online) is
too much like [Only Sense Online](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/vu0mg3k/),
which is HSTS, and I liked DUO because it’s AGP[^fn1]—the main character of
which, per the tradition of Japanese gender bender series, has a typically
feminine name: [紅](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B4%85#Japanese) (Kou,
“crimson”). The name is relevant beyond just being too girly for a “boy,” the
meaning of it also comes into play both in that Kou is a vampire and that her
in-game name, “Crim,” is a clipping of the English translation
“[crimson](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crimson).” This had me thinking about
the word “crimson” _a lot_, and I got this vibe that the word didn’t seem
particularly European in origin, thinking that it was perhaps Turkic instead.
While I was right that the word is borrowed from outside Europe, I was wrong on
its actual origin, you see. “Wait, doesn’t the title say this article is about
‘algorithm?’” Shh, just ride it out.
{:.dropcap}

In this case, Wiktionary gives a satisfactory etymology right off the bat:
INE-PRO
[_\*kʷŕ̥mis_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/k%CA%B7%C5%95%CC%A5mis)
(“worm”) \> IIR-PRO
[\*_kŕ̥miš_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/k%C5%95%CC%A5mi%C5%A1)
(“worm”) \> FA-CLS/PAL کرمست (_kirmist_) _\>_ AR
[قِرْمِز](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B2#Arabic)
(_qirmiz_, “[kermes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermes_(insect)>) insect,
crimson”) \> OSP _cremesín_ or FR _cramoisin_ \> ENM
[_cremesyn_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cremesyn#Middle_English) \> EN
[crimson](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crimson#English). Oddly, however, the
article for ENM _cremsyn_ both asserts that the word is borrowed from Old
Spanish (OSP) and that it is “ultimately from Sanskrit कृमिज (_kṛmija_),” which
is not at all supported by the reference provided (which attributes the word to
Medieval Latin (LA-MED)[^fn2] _cremesinum_/_crimismus_ and says it’s ultimately
from Arabic).[^fn3] Regardless, this all implies that “crimson” means something
like “worm colored,” which I often joke about, much to my wife’s chagrin;
however, it would be more accurate to say that it means “kermes colored,” as
“kermes” are the insects from which the dye was extracted (even if the name for
the insects essentially means “worm”).
{:.no-indent}

So why did I think it was Turkic? That would likely be due to associating it
with the Turkic word KK
[قىزىل](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D9%89%D8%B2%D9%89%D9%84) (_qyzyl_,
“red”)[^fn4] as in the
[Kyzylkum Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyzylkum_Desert), KK قىزىلقۇم
(_qyzylqūm_, lit. “red desert”). Of course, the examples here are from Kazakh,
which is only one of the Turkic languages, but it is true for Uyghur as well. On
the other hand, in Azerbaijani, قِیزِیل‌
([_qızıl_](https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%C4%B1z%C4%B1l)) has come to mean
“gold,” though its Turkish equivalent
[_kızıl_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%B1z%C4%B1l#Turkish) still retains
the meaning of “bright red, scarlet;” both languages, however, share their
primary word for red in a cognate of “crimson.” Per
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1#Turkish), the
etymology for that looks like FA-CLS کرمست (_kirmist_) _\>_ AR
[قِرْمِز](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B2#Arabic)
(_qirmiz_) + [ـِيّ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%8A#Arabic:_nisba)
(_-iyy_, [nisba](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nisba#English) (adjective
forming) suffix) \> AR
[قِرْمِزِيّ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%8A#Arabic)

[قرمزی](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B2%DB%8C#Ottoman_Turkish)
(_kırmızı,_ “red”) \> TR
[_kırmızı_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1#Turkish)
(“red”) and AZ قیرمیزی (_qırmızı_, “red”). So, in a sense, I wasn’t that far
off… at least I could argue such a thing had I not admitted associating it with
Kyzylkum, which I obviously did because I always have the
[Amu Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya) (or “Oxus”) on my mind.

You know what? Let’s just talk more about the Amu.[^fn5] My wife recently
accosted me for not telling her about the Oxus Civilization given my interest in
the Amu; however, the “Oxus Civilization” typically refers to the
[Bactria-Margiana Archeological Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana_Archaeological_Complex)
(BMAC), which evidence points to having been mostly centered around
[Margiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margiana) (from GRC _Μαργιανή_
(_Margianḗ_)), the watershed of the
[Murghab River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghab_River) (FA مرو (_marv_,
“[Merv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv)”) + آب (_âb_, “river”) \>
[مرغاب](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8)
(_Morğâb_))[^fn6] after which it was named, rather than
[Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria) (PEO
[𐎲𐎠𐎧𐎫𐎼𐎡𐏁](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%90%8E%B2%F0%90%8E%A0%F0%90%8E%A7%F0%90%8E%AB%F0%90%8E%BC%F0%90%8E%A1%F0%90%8F%81#Old_Persian)
(_Bāxtriš_) \> GRC _Βακτριανή_ (_Baktrianḗ_) \>\> EN _Bactria_),[^fn7] a region
around the upper Amu between the
[Pamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamir_Mountains) and
[Hindu Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush) mountains.[^fn8] Her
reasoning for this, on the other hand, is actually more related to Bactria,
specifically the Sapalli Culture which has been theorized to be one of the
sources of [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) tin in
[Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia).[^fn9] The problem with
this is that I’ve never cared about Bactria myself, perhaps I have mentioned
[Transoxiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transoxiana) (which could be said to
include Bactria depending on whether or not you equate it to the
[Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire)’s
[Sogdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogdia)) in the
[past](https://anarchy.website/oxia), but what interested me previously[^fn10]
was instead [Khwarazm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarazm).

The Amu Darya’s delta as it merges into the
[Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) forms a large oasis known as

[Chorasmia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chorasmia#English) (PEO \> GRC
[_Χορασμία_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%A7%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek)
(_Khorasmía_) \> LA
[_Chorasmia_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chorasmia#Latin) \> EN). The
history of Khwarazm, like many regions of
[Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia), is rife with
conquests from one group or another; however, as it isn’t the focus of this
section, let’s speedrun this. In the Bronze Age, Khwarazm was an expansion of
the BMAC, followed by its own
[Kelteminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelteminar_culture) (c. 3000 BCE),
[Suyarganovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suyarganovo_culture) (c. 2000 BCE),
[Tazabagyab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazabagyab_culture) (c. 1500 BCE),
Amirabad (c. 1000 BCE), then [Saka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka) (c. 500
BCE) culture. Likely c. 530 BCE, Khwarazm was conquered by
[Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great), and it was
then held by the [Achaemenid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire)
or Persian Empire until c. 525 BCE.[^fn12] The region was again invaded and
became a [satrapy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorasmia_(satrapy)>) of the
Persians under [Darius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I) (422-486 BCE)
until the Macedonian Conquest led by
[Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) (c. 330
BCE). In the subsequent
[Hellenistic Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period), Khwarazm
became an independent kingdom, as Alexander never reached so far[^fn13] and only
made peace with the Khwarazmian king Pharasmanes,[^fn14] seemingly never falling
under control of its [Seleucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid) (312-63
BCE) and [Greco-Bactrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom)
(256-120 BCE) neighbors.[^fn15] From the early first century CE,[^fn16] the
native and semi-legendary [Afrighids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrighids)
ruled the region, becoming vassals to the
[Sasanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) Empire under
[Ardashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I) after an invasion c. 239/40
CE[^fn17] or under [Shapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I) c. 243
CE,[^fn18] [Hephtalites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephthalites),
[Göktürk Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Turkic_Khaganate),
likely becoming an independent feudal kingdom again until the eighth
century,[^fn19] then again vassal to the
[Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate) (very
temporarily under occupation by
[Umayya ibn Abdallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayya_ibn_Abdallah_ibn_Khalid_ibn_Asid),
governor of [Khorasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan)
(693-697),[^fn20] then more permanently by
[Qutaiba ibn Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim) in
711/712),[^fn21]
[Abbasid Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate), and
[Samanid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanid_Empire) (initially only
the north was ruled as the south retained independence until 995).[^fn22] This
dynasty ended when the last of the line,
[Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_'Abdallah_Muhammad),
was executed by
[Ma’mun ibn Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'mun_I_ibn_Muhammad)
in 995.[^fn23] The key point here is, somehow, the era of the Abassid Caliphate,
specifically c. 780-850; thus, I’ll hop off this little tangent[^fn24] and move
right along.
{:.no-indent}

[Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi), more formally محمد
بن موسى الخوارزميّ (_Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi_), was a notable
mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who is thought to have been from the
region of Khwarazm, as his name implies (and his name is really what we care
about here). His most influential work, الجبر
([_Al-Jabr_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jabr), “completion, rejoining”) or
الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة (_al-Kitāb al-Mukhtaṣar fī Ḥisāb al-Jabr
wal-Muqābalah_, “The Compendium on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”)
written c. 820 CE, covers solutions to linear equations and thus has become the
namesake of the field of [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra). More
interestingly, if only etymologically, was his work in arithmetic. Particularly,
al-Khwarizmi was instrumental to the adoption of
[Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals), adapted from
the Hindu numerals of India, along with a method for computation using these
numerals written out. When his works later spread through Europe in the 
12<sup>th</sup> century, his arithmetic methodology largely superseded the
[abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus), with his Latinized name of
[Algorizmi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Algorizmi) becoming the name for the
method as “[algorismus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorism).” This was then
modified as OFR
[_algorisme_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/algorisme#Old_French) \> FR
[_algorithme_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/algorithme#French) \> EN
_algorithm_,[^fn25] giving us the titular word of this article (it’s actually
way more fun to think about the development of OFR _algorisme_ \> ENM
[_augrym_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/augrym#Middle_English) \> EN
_augrim_). Yippee\![^fn26]

This one only took me until a day after I intended to publish it, even though I
started early and already had a full outline. There’s obviously a lot of
interesting stuff I didn’t get into here, but I’ll just tell you the one stuck
in my head. A lot of the archeological sources on Khwarazm focus heavily on
[numismatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics) where, they note, the
region often did not have their own coinage and when they did it was in the form
of facsimiles of coins from neighboring regions. This has the fun consequence of
Khwarazmians copying coins with Greek legends without speaking or even
understanding Greek themselves, thus the legends became increasingly fanciful
decorative patterns. This momentarily brought to my mind the question of whether
such occurrences have happened that entire peoples adopted another peoples’
script as decoration; only momentarily, as I immediately recalled the use of the
Mongol [‘Phags-pa script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BCPhags-pa_script)
in[ Medieval European art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_elements_in_Western_medieval_art).
While we’re talking about Greek, how did it take me until I was 27-years-old to
realize the letters [_omicron_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omicron#English)
(GRC
[_ὂ μικρόν_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%82_%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek)

    My wife said that if I write this then I should kill myself.[^1a] I am, of
    course, doubling down. I started reading DUO specifically because it was
    yuri, but instead of making out with Kou, Hijiri barely exists in the manga
    at all. Months of published chapters will go by without a single panel
    showing her face; but in the web novel, they’re girlfriends, going to
    aquariums and all that. Hell, to this day, Kou still hasn’t logged out of
    the game in the manga, which is when the real plot really starts to kick
    off, in my opinion.

    Wikipedia points out that “Murghab” could refer to another river, the
    [Bartang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartang), which it annoyingly calls 
    a river “rising in central-western Afghanistan.” This is annoying
    given that the river flows almost entirely through Tajikistan, though it
    does, in fact, rise in Afghanistan. Furthermore, it has three names:
    “Aksu”/“Oksu” at its upper reaches (including the section in Afghanistan, of
    course), “Murghab” for the middle reaches (after passing the city
    [Murghab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murghab,_Tajikistan)), then
    “Bartang” after being joined by the Ghudara.

    This derivation is a bit of a mess, actually. I don’t know how it went from

    gives another etymology: AE/PEO _Bakhdi_ \> PAL _Bāxtriš_ \> FA _Baxl_ and

    It’s hard to actually pin down the exact area that is “Bactria” because it’s
    more of a polity than a topographic feature. It could be considered to be
    south of the Amu Darya, north of the Hindu Kush mountains, extending west
    until Margiana. It could also be the entire basin(?) between the mountain
    ranges, as seen with the area north of the Amu being termed “North Bactria.”
    The inconsistency of terms and maps has been driving me crazy.
