A while back, I was reading Destiny Unchain Online‚Äîthe
[web novel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/destiny-unchain-online-i-became-a-vampire-girl-and-eventually-became-known-as-the-demon-king-of-blood/),
of course, the
[manga](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/90fdtn0/destiny-unchain-online) is
too much like [Only Sense Online](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/vu0mg3k/),
which is HSTS, and I liked DUO because it‚Äôs AGP[^fn1]‚Äîthe main character of
which, per the tradition of Japanese gender bender series, has a typically
feminine name: [Á¥Ö](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B4%85#Japanese) (Kou,
‚Äúcrimson‚Äù). The name is relevant beyond just being too girly for a ‚Äúboy,‚Äù the
meaning of it also comes into play both in that Kou is a vampire and that her
in-game name, ‚ÄúCrim,‚Äù is a clipping of the English translation
‚Äú[crimson](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crimson).‚Äù This had me thinking about
the word ‚Äúcrimson‚Äù _a lot_, and I got this vibe that the word didn‚Äôt seem
particularly European in origin, thinking that it was perhaps Turkic instead.
While I was right that the word is borrowed from outside Europe, I was wrong on
its actual origin, you see. ‚ÄúWait, doesn‚Äôt the title say this article is about
‚Äòalgorithm?‚Äô‚Äù Shh, just ride it out.
{:.dropcap}

In this case, Wiktionary gives a satisfactory etymology right off the bat:
INE-PRO

[ŸÇŸêÿ±ŸíŸÖŸêÿ≤](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B2#Arabic)
(_qirmiz_, ‚Äú[kermes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermes_(insect)>) insect,
crimson‚Äù) \> OSP _cremes√≠n_ or FR _cramoisin_ \> ENM
[_cremesyn_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cremesyn#Middle_English) \> EN
[crimson](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crimson#English). Oddly, however, the
article for ENM _cremsyn_ both asserts that the word is borrowed from Old
Spanish (OSP) and that it is ‚Äúultimately from Sanskrit ‡§ï‡•É‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ú (_k·πõmija_),‚Äù which
is not at all supported by the reference provided (which attributes the word to
Medieval Latin (LA-MED)[^fn2] _cremesinum_/_crimismus_ and says it‚Äôs ultimately
from Arabic).[^fn3] Regardless, this all implies that ‚Äúcrimson‚Äù means something
like ‚Äúworm colored,‚Äù which I often joke about, much to my wife‚Äôs chagrin;
however, it would be more accurate to say that it means ‚Äúkermes colored,‚Äù as
‚Äúkermes‚Äù are the insects from which the dye was extracted (even if the name for
the insects essentially means ‚Äúworm‚Äù).
{:.no-indent}

So why did I think it was Turkic? That would likely be due to associating it
with the Turkic word KK
[ŸÇŸâÿ≤ŸâŸÑ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D9%89%D8%B2%D9%89%D9%84) (_qyzyl_,
‚Äúred‚Äù)[^fn4] as in the
[Kyzylkum Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyzylkum_Desert), KK ŸÇŸâÿ≤ŸâŸÑŸÇ€áŸÖ
(_qyzylq≈´m_, lit. ‚Äúred desert‚Äù). Of course, the examples here are from Kazakh,
which is only one of the Turkic languages, but it is true for Uyghur as well. On
the other hand, in Azerbaijani, ŸÇŸê€åÿ≤Ÿê€åŸÑ‚Äå
([_qƒ±zƒ±l_](https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%C4%B1z%C4%B1l)) has come to mean
‚Äúgold,‚Äù though its Turkish equivalent
[_kƒ±zƒ±l_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%B1z%C4%B1l#Turkish) still retains
the meaning of ‚Äúbright red, scarlet;‚Äù both languages, however, share their
primary word for red in a cognate of ‚Äúcrimson.‚Äù Per
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1#Turkish), the
etymology for that looks like FA-CLS ⁄©ÿ±ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ (_kirmist_) _\>_ AR

(‚Äúred‚Äù) and AZ ŸÇ€åÿ±ŸÖ€åÿ≤€å (_qƒ±rmƒ±zƒ±_, ‚Äúred‚Äù). So, in a sense, I wasn‚Äôt that far
off‚Ä¶ at least I could argue such a thing had I not admitted associating it with
Kyzylkum, which I obviously did because I always have the
[Amu Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya) (or ‚ÄúOxus‚Äù) on my mind.

You know what? Let‚Äôs just talk more about the Amu.[^fn5] My wife recently
accosted me for not telling her about the Oxus Civilization given my interest in
the Amu; however, the ‚ÄúOxus Civilization‚Äù typically refers to the
[Bactria-Margiana Archeological Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana_Archaeological_Complex)
(BMAC), which evidence points to having been mostly centered around
[Margiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margiana) (from GRC _ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒÆ_

around the upper Amu between the
[Pamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamir_Mountains) and
[Hindu Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush) mountains.[^fn8] Her
reasoning for this, on the other hand, is actually more related to Bactria,
specifically the Sapalli Culture which has been theorized to be one of the
sources of [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) tin in
[Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia).[^fn9] The problem with
this is that I‚Äôve never cared about Bactria myself, perhaps I have mentioned
[Transoxiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transoxiana) (which could be said to
include Bactria depending on whether or not you equate it to the

(_Khorasm√≠a_) \> LA
[_Chorasmia_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chorasmia#Latin) \> EN). The
history of Khwarazm, like many regions of
[Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia), is rife with
conquests from one group or another; however, as it isn‚Äôt the focus of this
section, let‚Äôs speedrun this. In the Bronze Age, Khwarazm was an expansion of
the BMAC, followed by its own
[Kelteminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelteminar_culture) (c. 3000 BCE),
[Suyarganovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suyarganovo_culture) (c. 2000 BCE),
[Tazabagyab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazabagyab_culture) (c. 1500 BCE),
Amirabad (c. 1000 BCE), then [Saka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka) (c. 500
BCE) culture. Likely c. 530 BCE, Khwarazm was conquered by
[Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great), and it was
then held by the [Achaemenid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire)
or Persian Empire until c. 525 BCE.[^fn12] The region was again invaded and
became a [satrapy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorasmia_(satrapy)>) of the
Persians under [Darius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I) (422-486 BCE)
until the Macedonian Conquest led by
[Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) (c. 330
BCE). In the subsequent
[Hellenistic Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period), Khwarazm
became an independent kingdom, as Alexander never reached so far[^fn13] and only
made peace with the Khwarazmian king Pharasmanes,[^fn14] seemingly never falling
under control of its [Seleucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid) (312-63
BCE) and [Greco-Bactrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom)
(256-120 BCE) neighbors.[^fn15] From the early first century CE,[^fn16] the
native and semi-legendary [Afrighids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrighids)
ruled the region, becoming vassals to the
[Sasanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) Empire under
[Ardashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I) after an invasion c. 239/40
CE[^fn17] or under [Shapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I) c. 243
CE,[^fn18] [Hephtalites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephthalites),
[G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Turkic_Khaganate),
likely becoming an independent feudal kingdom again until the eighth
century,[^fn19] then again vassal to the
[Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate) (very
temporarily under occupation by
[Umayya ibn Abdallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayya_ibn_Abdallah_ibn_Khalid_ibn_Asid),
governor of [Khorasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan)
(693-697),[^fn20] then more permanently by
[Qutaiba ibn Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim) in
711/712),[^fn21]
[Abbasid Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate), and
[Samanid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanid_Empire) (initially only
the north was ruled as the south retained independence until 995).[^fn22] This
dynasty ended when the last of the line,
[Abu ‚ÄòAbdallah Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_'Abdallah_Muhammad),
was executed by
[Ma‚Äômun ibn Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'mun_I_ibn_Muhammad)
in 995.[^fn23] The key point here is, somehow, the era of the Abassid Caliphate,
specifically c. 780-850; thus, I‚Äôll hop off this little tangent[^fn24] and move
right along.

[Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi), more formally ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ
ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿßŸÑÿÆŸàÿßÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖŸäŸë (_Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi_), was a notable
mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who is thought to have been from the
region of Khwarazm, as his name implies (and his name is really what we care
about here). His most influential work, ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±
([_Al-Jabr_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jabr), ‚Äúcompletion, rejoining‚Äù) or

written c. 820 CE, covers solutions to linear equations and thus has become the
namesake of the field of [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra). More
interestingly, if only etymologically, was his work in arithmetic. Particularly,
al-Khwarizmi was instrumental to the adoption of
[Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals), adapted from
the Hindu numerals of India, along with a method for computation using these
numerals written out. When his works later spread through Europe in the 
12<sup>th</sup> century, his arithmetic methodology largely superseded the
[abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus), with his Latinized name of
[Algorizmi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Algorizmi) becoming the name for the
method as ‚Äú[algorismus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorism).‚Äù This was then
modified as OFR

This one only took me until a day after I intended to publish it, even though I
started early and already had a full outline. There‚Äôs obviously a lot of
interesting stuff I didn‚Äôt get into here, but I‚Äôll just tell you the one stuck
in my head. A lot of the archeological sources on Khwarazm focus heavily on
[numismatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics) where, they note, the
region often did not have their own coinage and when they did it was in the form
of facsimiles of coins from neighboring regions. This has the fun consequence of
Khwarazmians copying coins with Greek legends without speaking or even
understanding Greek themselves, thus the legends became increasingly fanciful
decorative patterns. This momentarily brought to my mind the question of whether
such occurrences have happened that entire peoples adopted another peoples‚Äô
script as decoration; only momentarily, as I immediately recalled the use of the
Mongol [‚ÄòPhags-pa script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BCPhags-pa_script)
in[ Medieval European art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_elements_in_Western_medieval_art).

    My wife said that if I write this then I should kill myself.[^1a] I am, of
    course, doubling down. I started reading DUO specifically because it was
    yuri, but instead of making out with Kou, Hijiri barely exists in the manga
    at all. Months of published chapters will go by without a single panel
    showing her face; but in the web novel, they‚Äôre girlfriends, going to
    aquariums and all that. Hell, to this day, Kou still hasn‚Äôt logged out of
    the game in the manga, which is when the real plot really starts to kick
    off, in my opinion.

    given that the river flows almost entirely through Tajikistan, though it
    does, in fact, rise in Afghanistan. Furthermore, it has three names:
    ‚ÄúAksu‚Äù/‚ÄúOksu‚Äù at its upper reaches (including the section in Afghanistan, of

    This derivation is a bit of a mess, actually. I don‚Äôt know how it went from

    It‚Äôs hard to actually pin down the exact area that is ‚ÄúBactria‚Äù because it‚Äôs
    more of a polity than a topographic feature. It could be considered to be

    until Margiana. It could also be the entire basin(?) between the mountain
    ranges, as seen with the area north of the Amu being termed ‚ÄúNorth Bactria.‚Äù
