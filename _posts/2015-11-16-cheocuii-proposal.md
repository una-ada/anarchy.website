## Introduction

In light of recent discussion on the UW System’s coal contract in relation to
environmentalism and movements on campus to promote more sustainable systems,
little discussion is being held about the actual energy efficiency of individual
buildings.

## Significance

Highlighting which buildings need updates for heat efficiency during winter, to
help increase the overall sustainability of the campus. Increased heat
efficiency will also correlate to lower heating costs for the campus. We will
also be comparing the quality and effectiveness of cheaper thermal imaging
hardware, which will show the viability of using thermal imaging for
preventative maintenance. The less expensive IR cameras are also more portable
and less risky to transport.

## Objectives

1.  Study the heat signatures of six buildings on campus.
2.  Compare each building’s construction year to its heat signatures.
3.  Locate specific areas on buildings that require the greatest improvement in
    heat efficiency.
4.  Write detailed documentation on file manipulation for the thermal imaging
    camera.
5.  Examine the quality difference between the ~20,000USD IR camera already
    owned and the 2200USD camera.

## Methods

We will be collecting quantitative data from the thermal imaging camera and
using it to develop heat signatures for each of the six buildings we choose to
study. Several images will be made for each building to ensure accuracy and
totality of the data collected; we will be taking these images with both the
already available camera and the more affordable one so as to compare the usage
of the two along with collecting the data. The data will be analyzed using the
free software provided by Fluke, the manufacturer of the equipment. We plan on
completing the entire project over J-Term along the following schedule. Doing
this will minimize the variation during data collection by having the greatest
contrast between the building and the background.

-: | :-
Before Jan. 2016 | Preliminary research and equipment collection.
Jan. 11-16, 2016 | Data collection from the buildings, one building per day at about the same time to eliminate extraneous variations in the data.
Jan. 18-22, 2016 | Compilation of the data.
Jan. 25-29, 2016 | Finalization of the report and presentation.

## Dissemination

The research will be conducted over J-Term so the data will be ready to be
presented by the spring semester, as such we plan to give a presentation on our
work to the Society of Physics Students during one of their regular meetings and
also to the student environmental committee ECOS.
