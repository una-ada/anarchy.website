## Preface

Hello everyone! I’m Chloe… and I’m Una… and welcome to the fourth installment of Chloe and Una’s Tentacular Experience, a weekly podcast bringing you the hottest hentai reviews for your slutty slutty ears. Today we’re going to talk about one of Kyockcho’s ongoing series, Kaede to Suzu!
[insert theme song] As usual, anytime one of us discovers a new fetish we will be playing this sound [sound].
{:.content__p_dropcap}

## I. _Background_

Kaede & Suzu is the story of Kaede and Suzu, a pair of twin girls, and Hayato, their childhood friend/boyfriend(?). Kaede plays the role of the straight and narrow tsundere, Suzu on the other hand is perhaps best described as a kuudere, aloof, and quiet. Hayato is the dumb guy character. Throughout the series Kaede and Hayato both at points act as the audience POV character, as the story is mostly Suzu terrorizing the two of them while revealing as little of her own personality as possible.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

Kyockcho expresses in the afterword of Lovely (the first volume of original works by the author) that his primary goal was to show the expressions on girls’ faces while horny/cumming. One metric to judge a work by is how well it meets its own goals, so how well the expressions convey arousal and pleasure, and how that conveyance contributes to the story and art, will be key to determining whether this series is one of the greatest pieces of literature in human history, or if it’s complete garbage and not worth the paper it’s printed on.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The Hentai Word of the Week is “fixed-point camera” (定点カメラ, _teitten kamera_), a common technique used in manga, and often showing up in Kyockcho’s work, where all the panels on a page are from the same perspective. You can think of it as the time lapse of manga!

## II. _The Manga_

### II-1. Kaede & Suzu

Suzu instructs Kaede and Hayato to meet her in the Student Council room after 
school, where they find a mysterious cardboard box with a hole in it on a 
table. Kaede sticks her hands in the obvious trap and finds her wrists bound 
with rope.

Suzu suddenly appears with a Hitachi vibrator and hentai ensues. Suzu at one 
point reveals Kaede frequently yells out Hayato’s name while masturbating, thus 
her reasons for arranging this convoluted meeting.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-2. Kaede & Suzu 2

In chapter 2 we find Kaede and Suzu dressed in maid outfits; school festival 
maid cafe and all that. Kaede explains that Suzu caught her masturbating and 
saying Hayato’s name (again), and is now blackmailing her into wearing remote 
vibrators at the cafe, giving the controller to Hayato and letting him give 
them both the ol’ buzz-buzz throughout the day.

Eventually it becomes too much and an angry Kaede drags Hayato and Suzu to the 
bathroom where they have a threesome, resulting in what can only be described 
as one of the greatest manga pages of all time.
{:.content__p_noindent}

In the end, the socially inept Suzu reveals Kaede’s secret the moment she’s 
asked by Hayato, making Kaede’s compliance meaningless, but also begging the 
question “what’s the point in hiding the fact that you think about someone 
while you masturbate by having sex with them in a bathroom stall?”
{:.content__p_noindent}

Aina from the “Lovely Aina-chan” series can be seen in the background of the 
maid cafe. Nice world building!

### II-3. Kaede & Suzu 3

In Chapter 3, Kaede ties up Suzu in her room in order to get revenge for the 
previous two chapters of antics, recruiting Hayato for help. Kaede has an “I 
don’t know, I didn’t think I’d get this far” moment before Hayato starts 
squeezing her boobs.

The jealous Kaede beats him unconscious and then does the same thing herself, 
very quickly escalating from poking and prodding to fingering the restrained 
Suzu. Hayato wakes up and the trio begin doing their usual thing. Afterwards 
Hayato heads home and Kaede and Suzu share a tender moment in bed together.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Kaede and Suzu are so in love. I mean like Suzu has obviously been into Kaede 
this whole time but Kaede really starts to show her feelings for Suzu here.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-4. Kaede & Suzu 4

This chapter finds Hayato blindfolded in a hotel room, when the blindfold is 
removed he sees Kaede and Suzu in lingerie wishing him a happy birthday. They 
then have birthday sex. Yeah that’s pretty much it. It’s far from bad but it 
lacks the sort of tension and intrigue of the previous chapters while getting 
right into the sex scenes, so if you’re a fan of straight to the point this 
chapter will definitely be a highlight for you. 

Some highlights are the moment when Hayato almost breaks the fourth wall and 
asks “How did you get behind me?” when Suzu goes from on her knees in front of 
him to breathing down his neck in the next panel. As well as Hayato using the 
two of them for today’s hentai word of the day, double sumata.

[^1]: This one sometimes gets tagged in English as “multimouth blowjob.” [AniDB 
      just uses the term “double fellatio”](https://anidb.net/tag/3299) and 
      [VNDB uses “twin blowjob.”](https://vndb.org/g965)

[^2]: This is according to [Pixiv Dictionary](
        https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E9%87%8D%E3%81%AD%E9%A4%85
      ), but [on Pixiv itself](
        https://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E9%87%8D%E3%81%AD%E9%A4%85
      ) there are very few works with this tag.

[^3]: _Kai awase_ also refers to scissoring, that is tribadism in the 松葉崩し 
      _matsubaku zushi_ position.

Kaede and Suzu demand seconds from him and eventually he passes out.  
Afterwards, Kaede says they have high expectations for what Hayato does for 
their birthday.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-5. Kaede & Suzu 4.5
	
In this short chapter, Kaede comes home to find no one else there. She 
immediately whips out her headphones and masturbates to an audio file on her 
phone named “Hayato voice.”

She explains that she spent an entire night clipping together secret recordings 
of Hayato, including a line where he says “your breasts…are so much 
bigger…Kaede”, a callback to chapter 3 when he says that Suzu’s breasts are 
bigger than hers. This is, of course, the most wholesome way an anime (manga?) 
girl is capable of showing affection for someone, despite how stalker-ish it is 
to be secretly recording Hayato’s voice so much.
{:.content__p_noindent}

After she finishes she rolls over to find Suzu staring at her recording with 
her phone camera and says “I’m home.” While this could possibly be a prequel to 
Chapter 2, its placement after Chapter 4 instead implies that this sort of 
thing might just happen all the time.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Honestly my favorite parts of Kyockcho’s work is the gags, he could easily just 
write a non-H comedy manga and I’d be so into it lol

### II-6. Kaede & Suzu 5

In Chapter 5, Hayato enacts his plan–with a little help from Suzu– to return 
the favor from Chapter 4 to Kaede and Suzu. Suzu hands him some handcuffs and 
keys and says “the rest is up to you.”

Hayato cuffs the girls to the railing on the roof of the school and begins 
playing with Suzu while Kaede watches.
{:.content__p_noindent}

After a little while, Kaede, feeling incredibly cucked, jumps on Hayato and 
begs him to fuck her, saying that she loves him. Afterwards we see Suzu off to 
the side looking rather wistful, while Hayato and Kaede continue fucking.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Really glad Kaede was finally able to admit her feelings for Hayato, but when 
are Kaede and Suzu finally gonna admit their feelings for each other?

### II-7. Kaede & Suzu 6

Chapter 6 opens with Kaede and Hayato in full-on honeymoon mode, acting all 
lovey-dovey and ignoring The Suzu right next to them. Hayato invites Kaede over 
so the two of them can be alone together, and the jealous Suzu hatches a plan. 
When Kaede arrives wearing a maid dress per Hayato’s request, she finds Hayato 
tied and gagged in his bedroom, and behind her Suzu sneaks up with a pair of 
handcuffs.

Suzu binds Kaede and begins stripping her, followed by playing with her breasts 
and pussy, insisting she can’t cum until she says so. Suzu, now full-on yandere 
mode, offers Hayato the option to cum in her hands or in Kaede’s pussy, telling 
him “remember, Kaede and I are always together.”
{:.content__p_noindent}

Suzu asks Kaede to promise they’ll always be together, which she agrees to. 
That answers that question. The next day the three of them are walking together 
and Kaede offers Suzu her hand.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-8. Kaede & Suzu 7
	
Chapter 7 tells a classic story in the world of anime and manga: Suzu wins a 
trip to a hot spring in a lottery. The girls give Hayato handies on the train 
ride there, and tease him during the check-in process as well.

They get up to hentai stuff in a private bath at the hot springs, and Keade 
insists on fucking their shared boyfriend first.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Once they’ve finished, Suzu grabs Hayato and tells him to cum inside her, as he 
has done that to Kaede multiple times throughout the series but not yet to 
Suzu. The chapter ends on that cliffhanger, very cool.
{:.content__p_noindent}

## III. _The Anime_

In 2022, Kaede and Suzu was adapted into a 2 episode OVA, each episode contains 
2 chapters of the manga, with Episode 1 covering Chapters 1 and 2, and Episode 
2 adapting Chapters 4 and 5. There aren’t a lot of changes between the 
adaptation and the source material, with the exception of the omission of 
chapter 3.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

At one point in Episode 1, during the first sex scene, Kaede pisses herself, 
something which wasn’t obvious in the manga as there are a lot of fluids that 
come out of people during intercourse, and the black and white manga coloring 
didn’t lend itself to letting the audience know the fluid was yellow.
{:.content__p_noindent}

This is one of the ways that an anime adaptation of a manga has to surpass its 
source material, as adaptation is typically an uphill battle in terms of making 
something which can stand up beside the original in terms of quality.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Overall it’s a pretty textbook Pink Pineapple hentai adaptation. You know “pink 
film” means like cheap/low quality erotic videos in Japan, so maybe they know 
what they’re doing. Far from groundbreaking, a lot of the 26 minute run times 
of each episode is just extended shots of a penis thrusting into a mouth or 
vagina repeatedly. Basically any panel in the manga that’s just full of sound 
effects gets translated as an extended .gif like this, but of course what else 
would you expect from animated sex scenes?

Adapting written erotica into video form will always suffer from a temporal 
issue. When reading a manga you can stare at a panel as long as you’d like, or 
rush through it as quickly as possible, however is most conducive to your 
enjoyment as a reader. But when viewing an animation your timing is determined 
by what the director and animation staff decided it would be, how long you 
looked at Kaede and Suzu making out or Double Sumata-ing Hayato isn’t up to you 
as the viewer.
{:.content__p_noindent}

This isn’t to say they did a bad job of that, rather that it’s an inherent 
problem of adapting written works into audio-video, and ultimately it just 
creates a *different* media experience rather than a better or worse one. I 
think because it’s a story I had previously enjoyed as a manga, my opinion of 
the anime is colored by my previous notions of what it should or shouldn’t be, 
but as an adaptation I think it’s decent but not perfect. A solid 10 out of 10.

## IV. _Themes and Critique_

I think Kyockcho is an amazing artist, who’s really good at character design, 
and is really good at inserting humor especially in a genre that typically 
doesn’t care about humor, but suffers from a lot of the same problems that 
straight men writing pornography do where it follows these sort of traditional 
views on how women should act about sex.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

Specifically in that women are only allowed to show enjoyment or pleasure from 
sexual acts after an initial wall of reluctance to be overcome. Kaede becomes 
more forward in later chapters after this wall has already been worn down. For 
example, in Volume 2 of the anime or Chapter 4 of the manga, where both Kaede 
and Suzu meet with Hayato in a hotel room for his birthday, this is treated as 
a special occasion and thus a treat for Hayato rather than just a desire of 
Kaede.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Suzu, on the other hand, is treated as a driving factor in the plot. Her 
desires are treated as those of a “matchmaker” character, so while she is 
generally more forward about sex in general, it is not for her own sake. Most 
of her own sexual desires are treated as a form of jealousy throughout.
