## Introduction

The goal of this project is to compete in the NASA Midwest High Powered Rocket
Competition, which includes teams from throughout the nation. This competition
entails designing a high-powered rocket with an active braking system to be
launched twice, once with and once without the activation of the brake system.
Along with the physical rocket launches themselves, two written reports are to
be submitted and two presentations are required for the competition. Especially
with the dawn of private commercial space flight, the research done for this
competition is highly applicable to real world situations pertaining to
controlling the aerodynamics of a rocket once it has been launched.

## Significance

Rocketry is a constantly growing field, with many companies, such as SpaceX,
Boeing, and Virgin Galactic, pioneering the private sector approach to space
travel. The field of rocket science is generally acknowledged to be complicated,
with many different approaches applied to all aspects ranging from launch
orientation, propulsion system, booster configuration, flight trajectory,
payload deployment, recovery, etc. Specifically, this research is focused on
demonstrating control of a rocket to decrease its final altitude once it has
been launched from the launch pad, engaging a mid-flight braking system after
motor burnout and disengaging the braking system before parachute deployment.

This study will be done on a much smaller scale than the rockets developed by
the aforementioned companies, but the conclusions drawn from it will be
applicable on a larger scale. The competition not only requires that the rocket
be stable and have an active drag system to control the velocity, but also that
there be systems in place for video monitoring of the system and for the safe
recovery of the rocket, i.e. parachutes to slow the descent to ensure that the
rocket lands softly in near perfect condition, but does not drift too far away,
enabling quick recovery and re-launch within one hour.

Most similar concepts are applied strictly to the recovery of the vessel, be it
during regular flight or in emergency. With the ability to control the velocity,
therefore compensating for irregularities in a launch, this technology could
allow flight corrects to avoid possible abort scenarios and in turn reduce the
budget risks of those missions. This project will not be covering such
situations, further study could be done based on the conclusions of this project
to test the applications of a drag system in the event of any failures upon
launch.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are fairly straightforward and meet the
requirements of the Midwest High Powered Rocket Competition in which we intend
to compete:
1.  Build and test a high-powered rocket with built-in drag system
2.  Write required reports (Preliminary Design, Flight Readiness, Flight
    Performance)
3.  Present oral Flight Readiness Presentation
4.  Launch Competition Flights

##  Methods

As the rocket motor requires a refill for every launch, it is most economical to
do the majority of the research in a theoretical sense beforehand. This mostly
involves simulations using software available either as downloadable open source
or provided by the Physics Department. The simulation results will be
qualitative as well as quantitative, indicating the effectiveness of a given
method of drag via the ratio of peak altitude with vs. without the braking
system engaged along with detailed position, speed, and acceleration vs. time
from launch to landing. The results of these tests will be vital to the
development of the rocket and its associated drag system.

After simulations and construction, there must be at least one test launch,
preferably two, to verify the stability of the overall design and capability of
the active drag system. These test launches will also serve to train the team to
be able to prepare the rocket for launch in a timely manner (since a key aspect
of the competition requires the second launch to occur within the span of a
single hour).

The final test of the system will be the launch as part of the competition. This
will show the effectiveness of our approach compared to that of other teams
throughout the country (note: while the competition is called the “Midwest High
Powered Rocket Competition,” teams are invited from across the country, with
contestants in 2015 from from as far as TX, OH, VA, KS). This competetive system
of research promotes creative perspectives for solving a problem. In a sense,
our team’s design and performance research will contribute to the research goals
of NASA that are to efficiently determine the most effective approach to
building an active drag system.

## Dissemination

As the competition launch is not until May, our work would not yet be ready for
presentation at any of the spring conferences. This means that we will not be
presenting at any large-scale events until the Fall Gala the following academic
year. The launch is after finals for the spring semester as well, and so we will
also need to wait until the following fall to present our work at the regular
Society of Physics Students meetings, which we intend to do. The competition
also requires an educational outreach presentation, which we plan to give at
Meyer Middle School and/or Hudson Senior High School.
