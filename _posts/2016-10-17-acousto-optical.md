## Introduction

The acousto-optical effect is the change in refractive index of a material
caused by an acoustic wave applied to said material. This is a particular case
of photoelasticity, which can be used to experimentally measure stress
distributions within a material[^1], where the difference in refractive indices
(represented by the optic indicatrix[^2] $B$) along each axis is caused by
acoustic waves rather than mechanical tension. The change in optical
indicatrices is found then with the equation

$$\nabla B_i=p_{ij}a{j},\tag1$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the photoelastic tensor and $a_j$ is the
strain[^3]. However, it can be assumed that if a laser is being used as a light
source normal to a single axis $z$, then only the refractive index along said
axis needs to be calculated to predict the path of the light. It is also
assumed that the acoustic wave applied to the refractive material is planar in
the following calculation of the refractive index:

$$n(z,t)=n_0+\Delta n\cos(2\pi ft-Kz),\tag2$$

where $n_0$ is refractive index of the material without strain, $f$ is the
frequency and $K$ is the wave number of the acoustic wave, and $\Delta n$ is the
refractive index change caused by the acoustic wave:
{: .content__p_noindent}

$$\Delta n=-\frac{1}{2}n_0^3 pa.\tag3$$

This creates a diffraction grating along the z-axis moving as the acoustic wave
moves along the same axis. The diffraction pattern of this grating will fall
into one of two categories: the Raman-Nath Regime or the Bragg Regime,
determined by the Klein-Cook Parameter:

$$Q=\frac{2\pi\lambda_0L}{n_0\Lambda^2}
    =\frac{2\pi\lambda_0Lf^2}{n_0v^2},\tag4$$

where $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of the optic wave; $L$ is the distance
across the acoustic wave that the optic wave travels; $\Lambda$ is the
wavelength, $f$ is the frequency, and $v$ is the velocity of the acoustic wave.
The diffraction falls into the Raman-Nath Regime when $Q\ll 1$, and the Bragg
Regime when $Q\gg 1$. The Raman-Nath Regime gives multiple diffractions at
several angles, which is not optimal for the creation of a deflector, as such it
is best to remain within the Bragg Regime.

**FIGURE 1.** An example of an acousto-optic deflector, showing the material
with the acoustic waves vertically oriented and a width of $L$. This example
assumes Bragg Regime, and therefore has an incident angle of $\theta_B$ from the
horizontal, and a diffraction pattern with two maxima: the 0th order maximum at
$-\theta_B$ and the 1st order maximum at $\theta_B$ from the horizontal.
{: .content__figure}

To ensure that the deflector follows this condition, the Klein-Cook Parameter
can be substituted into the condition for the Bragg Regime:

$$\begin{align}
\frac{2\pi\lambda_0L}{n_0\Lambda^2}&\gg1,\tag{5a}\\
2\pi\lambda_0L&\gg n_0\Lambda^2,\tag{5b}
\end{align}$$

which can be further simplified based on a few assumptions: using a common red
HeNe laser[^4] as the light source such that $\lambda_0 = 632.8nm$, and
paratellurite (TeO2)[^5] as the material through which the acoustic waves are
produced such that[^6] $n_0 = 2.259$. Substituting these values, the equation
becomes:
{: .content__p_noindent}

[^4]:   Using a HeNe laser as the light source since it is the only laser with
        which I have experience. It is also worth noting that having a source
        with a predetermined polarization allows for a more complete
        understanding of the acousto-optic effect via experimentation, and the
        HeNe lasers kept in the UW-River Falls Phys. Dept. exhibit such
        properties.

        paratellerium with an optic wavelength of 0.6328mkm.

$$L\gg\frac{b}{2\pi}\Lambda^2,\tag6$$

where $b = 3.570\cdot10^6 m^{-1}$.
{: .content__p_noindent}

Under the previous assumptions, and in the Bragg Regime, the diffracted light
beams will be found around the Bragg angle $\theta_B$ is given by the function:

$$\sin(\theta_B)=-\frac{\lambda_0f}{2n_iv}
\left[ 1+\frac{v^2}{\lambda_0^2f^2}(n_i^2-n_0^2)\right],\tag7$$

where $n_i$ is the refractive index of the incident beam. If $n_i=n_0$, as it
would in an isotropic material (a crystal whose refractive index is equal in all
directions), then the above equation simplifies nicely to:
{: .content__p_noindent}

$$\sin(\theta_B)=-\frac{\lambda_0f}{2n_iv},\tag8$$

Paratellerium is not isotropic, it is uniaxial, having the same refractive index
along two axes but a difference in the third axis, giving its optical indicatrix
the shape of a uniaxial ellipsoidal surface. However, so long as the material is
oriented in such a way that the angle of incidence is between the two axes of
equal refractive index, the $n_i=n_0$ for this case and Eq. 8 can be used rather
than the more complicated Eq. 7.

The clearest usage of an acousto-optical deflector is to create a scanning beam,
changing the 1st order diffraction’s angle by adjusting the acoustic wavelength.
This would suggest that a function for $\theta_B$ with respect to $\Lambda$
would be a more beneficial form:

$$\theta_B=\arcsin\left(-\frac{1}{2b\Lambda}\right).\tag9$$

## Methodology

To build the deflector for a wavelength of $632.8nm$, a laser of said frequency
is necessary in order to assure proper construction and tuning.

The deflector itself requires a tellurium dioxide crystal, as that is material
around which the calculations were done in the previous section; the size of the
crystal should be small enough to make the entire device wieldy but not too
small as to require extremely high frequency (low wavelength) acoustic waves to
produce the desired acousto-optic effect. As such a 10x9x5mm[^7] crystal should
sufficiently meet these requirements, updating the Klein-Cook parameter in Eq.
6 to:

[^7]:   This size is based on the crystals available at
        <http://www.unitedcrystals.com/TeO2.html>.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{0.005\cdot2\pi}{3.570\cdot10^6}m^2&\gg\Lambda^2,\tag{10a}\\
\Lambda^2&\ll8.800\cdot10^{-9}m^2,\tag{10b}\\
\Lambda&\ll9.380\cdot10^{-5}m,\tag{10c}
\end{align}$$

which can then be used to find a range of frequencies for the acoustic waves
needed to properly produce this effect. Given that the velocity of sound in
paratellurium is $4260m/s$:
{: .content__p_noindent}

$$\begin{align}
f&=\frac{v}\Lambda,\tag{11a}\\
f&\gg\frac{4260m/s}{9.380\cdot10^{-5}m},\tag{11b}\\
f&\gg 4.542\cdot10^7Hz,\tag{11c}
\end{align}$$

as such a piezeo-electric transducer capable of producing acoustic waves with a
frequency on the order of 10 MHz would be necessary. The dimensions of this
transducer should also match the dimensions of the crystal, such that the
transducer covers an area of at least 5x5mm on the bottom of the paratellurite.
To prevent the acoustic waves within the crystal from reflecting of causing
interference that may cause diffraction that deviates from the desired effect,
some acoustic absorbing material of at least the same size as the transducer
(5x5mm) needs to be placed on the opposing side of the crystal.

Housing for the deflector could easily be made a variety of ways, given that the
casing would be relatively simple yet small. Perhaps one of the more precise
methods would be to 3D print the casing. If such a printer is available for use
on this project, then the only further requirement to pursue this method would
be to obtain the ABS plastic for the construction. Other methods, such as
woodworking or cutting metal sheeting, present their own problems: wood has a
tendency to burn when heated, while the laser in this case may not have as much
of a problem with this, it is best to avoid this situation as much as possible;
metal is often very reflective, which could easily cause an incident with a
laser, though sufficient coating may prevent this, again it is best to avoid.
