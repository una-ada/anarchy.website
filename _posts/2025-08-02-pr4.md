In this case, it’s not entirely that I wasn’t working on anything, I just wasn’t
writing anything that could be published, okay? I was working on the map for my
fantasy world!
{:.dropcap}

Last time, I made a joke about the rarity of officially translated gender-bender
series. This is something I’m intimately familiar with, since I’ve been pretty
much constantly reading gender-bender series since I saw that one OVA of
[_To Love-Ru_](https://anidb.net/anime/5625) (To LOVE る -とらぶる- \[4/10\])
back in high school. You know the one… or don’t if you’ve never watched the
“what if we took the lucky pervert trope to the extreme” series. Anyway, there
have been some fairly major gender-bender series, as major as they get in the
genre anyway, of late… as in the past couple years.

[_Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/0d2tmuc/fantasy-bishoujo-juniku-ojisan-to)
(異世界（ファンタジー）美少女受肉おじさんと) or _Life with an Ordinary Guy who
Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout_ is a gender-bender _isekai_ rom-com
manga adapted to [an anime](https://anidb.net/anime/16325) in 2022. Hinata
Tachibana and his hot best friend Tsukasa Jinguuji are whisked away from their
dreadful office work lives to a fantasy world by some goddess who also latches
on to Tachibana’s drunken rambling by turning him into a beautiful girl. In
typical _isekai_ fashion, they’re each given cheat skills: Tachibana gains the
ability to charm anyone that looks at her and Jinguuji gains Tachibana’s
apartment as a sort of pocket dimension. They’re also given the typical task of
defeating the demon lord to be able to return home to their normal lives. It’s
rather good, if you’re looking for a straight gender-bender romance it’s a great
choice. An 8/10 at ch. 157 of the manga and having finished the anime. If you
want a faster-paced similar manga,
[_Tensei Shitara Ore ga Heroine de Aitsu ga Yuusha Datta_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/g93ny20/tensei-shitara-ore-ga-heroine-de-aitsu-ga-yuusha-datta)
(転生したらオレがヒロインであいつが勇者だった \[8/10\]) is also very good,
pushing the comedy of the _isekai_ setup much further.

[_Oniichan wa Oshimai!_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/fgf16kk/onii-chan-wa-oshimai)
(お兄ちゃんはおしまい!) is a fairly classic WUGOM gender-bender slice-of-life
manga which was adapted to an [anime](https://anidb.net/anime/17328) in 2023. It
follows Mahiro Oyama, a _hikiNEET_ in his twenties who gets turned into a
young-looking girl by his mad-scientist sister Mihari. It’s basically a flagship
of the _loli_ sub-genre, which often eschews the menstruation drama you find in
a lot of the
“[magical sex-shift](https://myanimelist.net/manga/genre/65/Magical_Sex_Shift)”
(as MAL calls it) type series for drama centered on the main character’s
misestimation of the capacity of their bladder. As much as I enjoy piss, I don’t
really care for the _loli_ transformation setup, especially considering its
treatment as regression[^fn1] to the point where Mahiro ends up enrolling in
elementary school. I started reading it back in 2019 and am up to ch. 82 at this
point, I don’t really keep up with it so it’s a low 5/10. The anime is well done
for what it is, with a very cute style and good animation, currently on hold at
ep. 7 however.

[_Ayakashi Triangle_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/gbnfccj/ayakashi-triangle)
(あやかしトライアングル \[4/10\]) a gender-bender romance _ecchi_ manga, which I
mentioned in the note about MANGA Plus, was adapted to
[an anime](https://anidb.net/anime/17063) in 2023. Matsuri tries to save his
childhood friend, Suzu, from being eaten by the King of Ayakashi, Shirogane,
managing to seal its powers but not before it curses him to turn into a girl.
It’s finished with 144 chapters, but I’ve only read up to ch. 97 before putting
it on hold, just as I’ve only seen the first few episodes of the anime.
{:.no-indent}

I must admit that I actually haven’t been keeping up with anime much the past
couple years, so the even more recent ones I just haven’t touched. Mainly
[_Ranma ½_](https://anidb.net/anime/18700) (らんま 1/2) was remade in 2024, I
never read the manga or watched the original which maybe always seemed out of
character but I do always prefer contemporary works. Then there’s
[_Akuyaku Reijou Tensei Ojisan_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/x9p4ven/akuyaku-reijou-tensei-oji-san)
(悪役令嬢転生おじさん) or _From Bureaucrat to Villainess: Dad’s Been
Reincarnated!_ adapted to [an anime](https://anidb.net/anime/18366) this year,
which just doesn’t seem very interesting to me (it does have an English dub, so
maybe I’ll put it on in the background at some point).
{:.no-indent}

[_Fake Saint of the Year_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/fake-saint-of-the-year/)
(理想の聖女？　残念、偽聖女でした！ ～クソオブザイヤーと呼ばれた悪役に転生したん
だが～) is a gender-bender _isekai_ light novel series about a man who finds
himself transported into the world of a visual novel which seemingly lacks any
true “good end” for the saint, Eterna. He, now she, hopes to orchestrate such an
end, only to find that rather than reincarnating as Eterna, she is Ellize, the
one who was swapped at birth with Eterna and treated as if _she_ were the saint
(essentially the “villainess” in the original game). Ellize then sets out to fix
the story from the perspective of the “fake saint” by simply not being a piece
of shit, including not tarnishing the reputation of saints to the point that
even Eterna would be hated when she took her rightful place as happened in the
“original.” The afterword of the first volume describes how the author intended
to write a story about a calculating, villainous protagonist who ends up instead
being very well-liked. This is often shown through Ellize’s internal monologue
of mocking those around her for believing the “acting” of such a “fake.” I’m not
really vibing with the story so far, it’s one of those setups where the
protagonist is overpowered per the standards of the setting (Ellize has 100k+ MP
whereas the “last boss” has 2-3k) but not per the standards of their desired
outcome (Ellize just wants to ensure Eterna has a happy ending). It’s also a
shame that it isn’t yuri, Ellize doesn’t take her desire for Eterna’s happy
ending into her own hands in that way, even after that weird misunderstanding
where Eterna believed the saint was keeping an eye on her for “oh no am I the
witch!?” reasons when Ellize was just perving out and staring at Eterna’s ass.
I’ll give it a tentative 5/10, on hold at vol. 2 ch. 34. I might finish it
eventually, since it is only four volumes.

[_Loner Life in Another World_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lonely-attack-on-the-different-world/)
(ひとりぼっちの異世界攻略) is a comedy _isekai_ web novel publishing since 2016,
adapted to
[a light novel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lonely-attack-on-the-different-world-ln/)
in 2018,
[a manga](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/k55bz8a/hitoribocchi-no-isekai-kouryaku)
in 2019, and [an anime](https://anidb.net/anime/18432) in 2024. I started
reading the manga forever ago, got up to ch. 191 before dropping it. It’s very
sporadic, with gag comedy and short chapters. Honestly, following the manga is
rather difficult so I give it a 4/10, this is also why I moved on to the web
novel. I read up to ch. 313 in the web novel, it’s much easier to follow along
with Haruka’s thought process when you get the full internal monologue, so a low
6/10. This is also the type of thing that gets you an “unreliable narrator” tag
on NU, which just isn’t a correct use of the term. A lot of series with the tag
simply have a narrator whose view of things is unconventional, the only
unreliability being in the differences provided by other characters’
perspective, e.g. the narrator believes something to be a minor issue that’s
easily solved while others see it as an impossible catastrophe. Another
advantage the novels have is that they aren’t missing parts! You might try to
claim a sex scene is unnecessary to the plot but when a series ends up with the
“sexual cultivation” tag, then you cut out all the sex, suddenly people just
have new skills out of fucking nowhere. There’s a reason the series has a
separate R18 version\![^fn2] Anyway, the anime is completely dubbed in English
now, so I watched it while working on world-building stuff. It’s a normal
low-quality anime adaptation, 4/10.

[_Akuyaku Reijou Tensei Ojisan_](https://anidb.net/anime/18366) (悪役令嬢転生お
じさん) or _From Bureaucrat to Villainess: Dad’s Been Reincarnated!_ is a comedy
gender-bender _isekai_ anime about a middle-aged (_ojisan_) bureaucrat finding
himself possessing the villainess in an _otome_ game. I’d say that it’s giving a
similar treatment to the _otomege_ villainess sub-genre of _isekai_ that
[_Isekai Ojisan_](https://anidb.net/anime/16389) (異世界おじさん \[6/10\]) gave
to the more mainstream _isekai_ genre, but rather than Tondabayashi Kenzaburou
narrating past events as Takafumi’s uncle did, Kenzaburou’s daughter, Hinako,
observes the game where he plays Grace Auvergne in real-time. In that sense, it
does remind me a bit of _Fake Saint_, where she can see the fanbase’s reactions
to her “route” in her “dreams.”[^fn3] It’s got a lot of “shoujo sparkle” moments
between Grace and the nominal protagonist of the game, Anna Doll, which is
clearly yuri-bait, at least to me. So what if Anna is technically “played” by
Hinako? Wouldn’t be the first father-daughter yuri I’ve seen… but it isn’t that.
Between this and _Fake Saint_ I’m getting yuri bait fatigue. 6/10, just because
it’s kinda funny.

[_I Became an Idol Loved by My ‘Idol’_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-became-an-idol-loved-by-my-idol/)
(최애에게 사랑받는 아이돌이 되었다) is a gender-bender yuri regression web novel
about a man, hurt by a controversy about his favorite idol, Yoo Na’min, who
suddenly finds himself waking up as a girl named Lee Seoyeon before said group
even formed. Quick note on the title, 최애 (_choiae_) is sometimes translated as
“ultimate bias” or “favorite,” similar to the Japanese term 推し (_oshi_) as it
is used to refer to a favorite idol, VTuber, &c., so translating it as ‘my idol’
here actually works fairly well.[^fn4] Similar to _Fake Saint_, Yeoseon is
overpowered in the world of idols, she has an attractive face, good singing
voice and control, and dances well, while her real goal is just to support
Na’min and ensure that what happened in her past life, five years from now,
doesn’t happen this time. I just started reading this last night, wanting some
actual yuri this time, so I’m only 24 chapters in. Tentatively giving this one a
5/10 as well.

Anyway, I’ve made a lot of good progress on that map. Going by the date stamps
it’s been about a year since I started it, obviously not continuously working on
it, so it feels good to see visible improvement. What’s that? It’s been two
months since my last “weekly” etymology article? It’s actually been longer since
my last “weekly” podcast, you know? Maybe you need to learn patience. I’m
certainly not anxious about either of these things… not at all.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:
    The regression genre seems significantly more popular in Korea, but you do
    see plenty of it in Japan. Typically, it isn’t just age-regression and is a
    full time-travel back to youth type thing. Notable Japanese examples include
    [_Tokyo Revengers_](https://anidb.net/anime/15601) (東京リベンジャーズ
    \[2/10\]) and [_Erased_](https://anidb.net/anime/11292) (僕だけがいない街
    \[2/10\]), both of which I dropped partway through as I really don’t like
    regression stories.

[^fn2]:
    The reason it’s separate is probably actually just that Syosetu is notable
    for being great for promoting series up to R15, but the moment you get
    flagged as R18 you end up on the spinoff sites which are just a total mess.

[^fn3]:
    I’m only nearing the end of the first volume as I write this entry, so I’m
    not really sure what’s actually happening there, but it’d probably be
    spoilers anyway

[^fn4]:
    Perhaps I care about this sort of translation so much as the terrible
    translation of _Watashi no Oshi wa Akuyaku Reijou_ (私の推しは悪役令嬢
    。\[8/10\])’s title as _I’m in Love with the Villainess_ is perhaps one
    factor in obnoxious misinterpretations of that series that posit Rei as
    being romantically attracted to Claire from the start rather than just
    admiring the fact that her favorite game character is alive right in front
    of her.
