    In this latest episode of Goth Angel Sinners, we've addressed complaints
    that the episodes were too long and that we are "over representing people
    born in 1997" while we discuss Spider-Man 3, cops, moral ambiguity, and
    Infinity War for some reason.

 - We pretend Leland has been here the whole time, but also he’s very British so
   this might be hard. We will try our best o7
 - Introduction:
   - L: _"Good Sextidi, everyone, and welcome to part three (3) of Goth Angel
     Sinners, a podcast about anarchy, anarchists, and anarchism, and not about
     Lil Peep."_
   - T: _"Presented by @trewbot..."_
   - C: _"...Χλόη (Chloe)..."_
   - L: _"...and Leland."_
   - T: _"Today we’re talking about Spider-Man 3, the movie in which Spider-Man
     beats the shit out of his childhood friend so hard he cucks himself."_
 - Is Spider-Man a cop?
 - Is the fight between Harry and Peter symbolic of the fights within
   transhumanism and the false dichotomy between biological changes and
   technological augmentations?
   - Peter is a "Spider"-Man, he relies on biological adaptation to be a
     superhero and whatnot.
   - Harry got Buff™ using some biological agent but ultimately relies on tools
     to fight Peter, requiring us to ask the question: to what extent is tool
     use simple "human nature" and to what extent can it be viewed as an
     augmentation that brings one beyond their humanity and into a sort of
     transhuman state?
 - Flint Marco turning into sand is the original Infinity War meme.
 - The "dancing scenes"...?
   - "Walk Like Tobey Maguire From Spiderman 3 down Rundle Mall"[^1]
     - "Tobey Maguire from Spiderman 3"
   - Interview with Tobey Maguire about Spider-Man 3 brought up the scenes and
     the darker side of Spider-Man in the movie[^2].
     - "[T]hat was Peter Parker dancing, not Tobey."
     - "**Any concern with being haunted by this role?** I’m not really
       concerned about it." &mdash; Tobey Maguire from Spider-Man 3
   - I had another article about this[^3] but apparently the author of the piece
     (and editor-in-chief of it’s platform) sexually assaulted people[^4][^5],
     like it’s the only thing that shows up when you google “Devin Faraci”
     (though it’s mostly from his point of view which is bad).
 - Eddie Brock is an incel. This is not a question it is a statement of fact.
   - All of the bits where Spider-Man is being edgy, Peter is actually doing
     what Eddie was trying to do but succeeding.
     - Flirting with Jameson’s secretary: she told Eddie to "go away" but with
       Peter she reciprocated.
     - The staff job at the paper: Eddie got it temporarily and under false
       pretenses, whereas Peter got it permanently.
     - Dating Gwen: Eddie claimed to have been dating her but really only went
       out for coffee once and she doesn’t really like him; Peter doesn’t really
       do this one well either since he takes her to the jazz cafe where MJ is
       working and she notices he’s doing it to get back at his ex.
 - The Stan Lee (dead guy) cameo has him saying "you know, I guess one person
   can make a difference," to which I say: "we live in a society."
 - Opinions of the film overall?
   - It currently has a 6.2/10 on IMDb[^6], a 59% on metacritic[^7], and a 63%
     on Rotten Tomatoes' "Tomatometer"[^8] (though we should just ignore Rotten
     Tomatoes because it sucks actually[^9]).
   - I (trew) thought it was pretty good; 5/10.
