title: Procrastination Report №2
---

It’s not that I’m not trying to write an actual article, using the idea of
publishing these reports as an excuse to procrastinate even further because I
will still write something anyway. No, it’s just that research is hard, way too
hard. Every time I try to get back into the next etymology article I hit a wall,
the only real way over the wall is to lower the standard of proof for certain
aspects just to force through them. I just don’t see myself as a reputable
enough source on linguistics to _not_ sprinkle every definitive statement with a
few dozen hours of at least secondary source readings.

[_Ms. Villainess, Playing with the Heroine’s Feelings Will Lead to Retribution, You Know?_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ms-villainess-playing-with-the-heroines-feelings-will-lead-to-retribution-you-know/)
(反派小姐，瞎撩女主是会被清算的) is a gender-bender _yuri_ harem _isekai_ web
novel, where the _isekai_ is a novel written by the main character, Lu Zhuxin.
The “original work” is an erotic _xianxia_ harem series borrowing elements from
omegaverse fiction, particularly in that “sword cultivators” have pure _yang_
energy while “fox demons” have _yin_ energy, with an inherent attraction between
the two. The “protagonist,” Song Shixuan, then learns a secret art that allows
his _yang_ energy to act as a pheromone which erodes the rationality of those
with _yin_ energy; typically such skills are reserved for the fox demons who fit
the typical seductress role of mythological foxes. The original Fox Queen,
having served as an early “boss” in the “original work” and thus having been
“tamed,” overcomes the confines of the fictional world just to kill the author
(I absolutely love this sort of thing, check out
[_Re:CREATORS_](https://anidb.net/anime/12657) \[8/10\]), leading to Lu Zhuxin
taking her place in the story. Lu Zhuxin would rather not follow the original
plot, being tamed by Song Shixuan into a “creampuff” (see below), thus she has
to undermine the force of the plot (Heavenly Dao) by taking all of Shixuan’s
future harem for herself so the story can’t continue as normal. As for how that
goes, well, the “mind break” tag certainly isn’t referring to Lu Zhuxin.

The plot is structured as a series of “conquest” arcs, similar to
[_Data a Live_](https://anidb.net/anime/8808) (デート・ア・ライブ \[2\~3/10\])
or [_The World God Only Knows_](https://anidb.net/anime/7568) (神のみぞ知るセカ
イ \[4\~7/10\]). Each arc is then dictated by the heroine to be wooed, with Lu
Zhuxin role-playing to fit the narrative she set up for it. The second arc in
particular is more akin to a sort of spy romance, where both Zhuxin and the
heroine are competing with information control; the closest I’ve gotten to
enjoying that genre is
[*SPY*×*FAMILY*](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/v5is1fi/spy-x-family)
\[9/10\], which doesn’t even count. Honestly, I’m not into omegaverse/ABO tropes
either, probably the only positive experiences I’ve had with them are various
secondary creations[^fn1] by [Mikanuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikanuji),
the author of
[_Fuzoroi no Renri_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/qzmscq4/fusoroi-no-renri)
(不揃いの連理 \[8/10\]), and that’s probably just because the art is good
enough; on the other hand, I do love any arbitrary justification for same-sex
reproduction, like the blood cocoons in
[_The Delicate Female Lead Only Wants to be Loved by the Villainous Young Ladies_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-delicate-female-lead-only-wants-to-be-loved-by-the-villainous-young-ladies/)
(娇软女主只想收获反派大小姐宠爱 \[7/10\]). There’s also the reincarnation into
erotica aspect, I obviously don’t mind a little spice but too blatant a setup
for lewdness is just annoying rather than hot most of the time, which is why I
never really read English web novels;[^fn2] plus, my last experience with the
idea was
[_Succubus’ Life in Another World_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/succubus-life-in-another-world/)
(サキュバスさんの異世界生活 \[4/10\]), which was mid enough for the author to
outright delete it. Regardless of all that, I did give this one a shot, putting
it on hold at ch. 196, giving it an alright 5/10.

I was working more on world-building for that web novel I mentioned I was going
to write last time, when I mentioned to my wife that the planet it is on is
actually a binary system, its moon being another inhabited planet. This brought
about a myriad of questions, particularly in how much the residents of the first
planet would be able to observe and discover about the other. I spent nearly a
whole day on thinking that over and doing some math to determine the distance it
should be at and how often they would orbit each other. Is two months a year a
bit weird? If there was a habitable planet 1.25 million kilometers away, when
would people be able to definitively say they know it _is_ inhabited? I am open
to suggestions on this question, the technological development of the world is a
bit chaotic anyway, not that I want it to be as extreme as
[_That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/)
(転生したらスライムだった件 \[7/10\])’s cyclical destruction of civilization.

[*Gakusei Gidai, Boku wo Ijimeteita Yankī*♂ _ga Buka Toshite Haittekita Ken_](https://www.fanbox.cc/@turisasu/posts/10233526)
(学生時代、僕をいじめていたヤンキー ♂ が部下として入ってきた件) is a _josou_ (女
装, “crossdressing”) _otokonoko_ (男の娘, “femboy/tomgirl”) erotic _doujinshi_ 
(同人誌, “self-published work”) about an ex-*yankī* (ヤンキー, “delinquent”) who
moves back to his hometown to work at a company owned by a guy he used to bully.
It’s an extension of the “Ex-Yankee OL” (元ヤンキー OL) section published in
TuriSasu (ツリサス)’s previous work
[_Bitches with Dicks \~Otokonoko Report\~_](https://www.fanbox.cc/@turisasu/posts/9189619)
(ついてるメス〜男の娘レポート〜), which was a compilation of posts to their
[pixivFanbox](https://www.fanbox.cc/@turisasu). TuriSasu did promise that some
stories in that compilation would get full manga, but I am a bit disappointed in
this being the first one. Sure, it was the first section, but the sort of power
dynamic revenge setup of “nobody else would hire you” isn’t exactly my favorite.
It is probably the only one that had forcefemming in it, though, so if that’s
what you’re going into it for then this is the best option. TuriSasu’s art is,
as usual, god-tier; they got so much better at drawing girls once they decided
the girls are boys. Anyway, only the first free (they release the non-erotic
sections of the stories without requiring subscription) and premium sections are
released so far, so it’s a tentative 6/10 just based on my love for the art
style.

[_Forced to Sell Myself to the Female Lead After Killing the Male Lead_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/forced-to-sell-myself-to-the-female-lead-after-killing-the-male-lead/)
(干掉男主的我被迫把自己卖给女主) is a gender-bender[^fn3] isekai yuri fantasy
web novel with a “reincarnated as the demon lord” sort of premise. I had
previously read up to vol. 7 ch. 40, so I’m just catching up on it this time.
I’ve seen some compare it to [_OVERLORD_](https://anidb.net/anime/10816)
\[5/10\], simply based on the villain role of the protagonist, Yu Mo, as well as
the presence of incredibly loyal subordinates, but it is a rather common setup,
actually. Maybe you could compare it to
[_The Eminence in Shadow_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/to-be-a-power-in-the-shadows/)
(陰の実力者になりたくて！\[6/10\]) based on how much Yu Mo just doesn’t know
what her children are actually doing. Yu Mo is reincarnated as the “Demon
Temple,” a source of abyssal power in a frozen forest that corrupts life into
abyssal demons, some of whom manage to retain or even gain a level of sentience,
seeing themselves as Yu Mo’s children. The initial presentation of the
reincarnation is that Yu Mo is given the task of being the “last boss,”
ultimately defeated by the Children of Destiny. She’s pretty into this goal,
trying constantly to control the narrative to give the Children of Destiny a
proper leveling experience; her adoptive children, on the other hand, don’t
understand why she’s suicidally supportive of the Children of Destiny, instead
opting to secretly hinder that plot. That’s about as much as I can say without
spoiling[^fn4] the whole plot, I’ll just hint that after Yu Mo gets to know the
Daughter of Destiny, Mengxi, her judgement of the Chosen Son becomes less about
if he can defeat her and more if he’s even deserving of Mengxi… because it’s
yuri. It actually feels really weird talking about all this setup with a
long-running web novel given that they tend to, y’know, shift context in the
later parts, so none of this is particularly relevant to the part I’ve actually
been reading. Catching up to vol. 7 ch. 140 and it’s still a solid 7/10

I’ll try really hard to get some actual writing done this week, I promise. That
aside, I’ve been really thinking about rereading
[_Ascendance of a Bookworm_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm/)
(本好きの下剋上 ～司書になるためには手段を選んでいられません～ \[8/10\]) lately,
at least for the world-building. Perhaps I’ll catch up on
[_Is It Funny That The Dragon Slayer Failed And Became The Dragon Princess?_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/is-it-funny-that-the-dragon-slayer-failed-and-became-the-dragon-princess/)
(屠龙失败变成龙族公主很好笑吗？\[6/10\]) because I’ve been thinking about
“tsundere POV” for some reason; or maybe
[_I Will Never Submit to Miss Grim Reaper_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-will-never-submit-to-miss-grim-reaper/)
(萝变的我绝不向死神小姐屈服 \[5/10\]) because I’ve been thinking about writing a
web novel and it’s about a web novel author… not that I’d want to write like
them, I was just reminded of it and remembered the more slice-of-life aspects of
it. What I mean to say is that I’m definitely going to get some writing done,
for sure.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:
    _Kimi no Koi wa Watashi no Koi_ (君の恋は私の恋) was the first one I read,
    because twincest, but was immediately like “oh shit I know this artist” and
    kind of just overlooked the omegaverse stuff.

[^fn2]:
    I would also note that there’s just more quality filters present when it
    comes to Chinese novels, both in the editorial oversight and in the choice
    of works to be translated into English. Then there’s the fact that it’s
    easier to overlook awkwardness in translated works, because you can assume
    it’s just a lack of familiarity with tropes, language, etc. Anyway, I try to
    read English web novels occasionally, but I just can’t get into “She’s the
    hottest smartest girl at smart hottie academy. Her only flaw? She’s so
    perfect she’s practically untouchable… except for me, I get to fuck her.”

[^fn3]:
    The translator claims that this series “is not gender bander, It will become
    clear after chapter 1000+” and I honestly have no clue what the fuck they
    meant by that. Even if \[SPOILERS\] the other personality within Yu Mo were
    to be the “original” personality and Yu Mo is just possession the Demon
    Temple along with them, then this series would _still_ be gender bender,
    because Yu Mo was a man on “Blue Star” and is now a woman! So it can’t be
    that, right? But that’s the only thing I can think of that’s revealed around
    ch. 1000. Anything revealed later just reinforces Yu Mo’s history further.
    Hell, could something even be barred from a genre based on a technicality?
    Only pedants do that, a series with all the gender-bender tropes of learning
    to live with a woman’s body can’t possibly convince me it isn’t
    gender-bender like that. The _Elf Queen_ blah blah _Sister_ one from the
    last entry would be even less gender-bender then, because \[SPOILERS\] she
    was originally the sister in question, just became a man in the meantime!

    There is also the thing where she inherited the power of a saint, and would
    thus eventually inherit the memories as well, does that mean she was
    originally a girl? Maybe? But like _Elf Queen_ it doesn’t matter.

[^fn4]:
    If you need some spoilers to hook you in further, the idea that Yu Mo is
    meant to be the final boss is a bit of a lie. This plot is more of a test of
    her strength and character. Even more spoiling, it’s a test to see if _she_
    is worthy of Mengxi, so dropping the whole getting killed thing to date
    Mengxi is well within expectations. That’s even after finding out the Son of
    Destiny is just a position that people get swapped into for the “trial” of
    this world.
