Perhaps I need to emphasize that this is a _procrastination report_, essentially
a blog about what I’ve been doing instead of writing, _not_ just a series of
reviews. I just happen to read a lot, so it includes a lot of reviews.
{:.dropcap}

[_Secrets of the Silent Witch_](https://anidb.net/anime/18795) (サイレント・ウィ
ッチ 沈黙の魔女の隠しごと) is a fantasy anime, adapted from a
[light novel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/silent-witch/), about a
traumatized, socially anxious girl named Monica Everett who learned to cast
magic without incantations to avoid speaking in front of others. I’ve only
watched up to ep. 5 as that was all that’s available at the time, but it’s good
so far. It is odd having the narration expound on Monica’s greatness as the
“Silent Witch” for her ability to cast silently while showing a scene of her
killing several dozen dragons simultaneously, like that’s supposed to be my
takeaway from that sight. Supposedly, it’s a romance series, reviews complain
about how reliant it is on _otomege isekai_ tropes, but I’ve yet to see any of
that. The soundtrack and the art have been very good so far, so I’m giving a
tentative 6/10.

[_Escaping Corruption: I’m Not the Dragon King’s Little Darling Wife!_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/escaping-corruption-im-not-the-dragon-kings-little-darling-wife/)
(远离恶堕:才不是龙王的小娇妻!) is a gender-bender yuri isekai web novel where
some guy, after completing the highest difficulty of a certain game, unlocks an
even harder difficulty that is just being transported into the game. The key
point of the premise is that the Dragon King (a woman, by the way) actually
retained memories of all the previous playthroughs, including the last one in
which the main character, now Reina, seemingly promised to be together with her.
It’s a sort of “pursued by a yandere” _ecchi_ series, with Reina trying her best
to pretend she _isn’t_ the guy the Dragon King knew. It’s hot if you’re into the
sort of falling into corruption yuri, I’ve only read up to ch. 7 though. I
dunno, give it a 5/10 and put it on hold.

Allow me to digress here about the rates that translators charge per reader per
chapter for access to their translations. I’m all for paying people for their
work but I highly doubt any of these translators, except for officially licensed
ones, are paying royalties to the original authors. At the low end, sites charge
15¢ ea. and the highest I’ve seen is a site charging between 75-95¢ ea. The
average chapter on [SFACG](https://www.sfacg.com/), since they charge per 1k
words, would be somewhere around 2-3¢ with a VIP account (discounted after
paying a certain amount). A lot of translators don’t even buy these chapters on
their own, they source them from their community, many of whom likely source the
raws from pirated sites in the first place. Then let’s talk about the actual
overhead, a good amount of translators are in groups that use
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) (\\$4-25/mo., \\$48-300/yr.)[^fn1] sites 
with Themesia’s [LightNovel](https://themesia.com/lightnovel-wordpress-theme/) 
theme (\\$18) and [myCred](https://mycred.me/) for payment processing and 
“gamification” (\\$99-299/yr. or \\$249-699). On top of that, many of 
them still have ads on the
site, often using [AdvancedAds](https://wpadvancedads.com/) (€59-89/yr.) or just
Google AdSense (\\$0), as well as requesting additional donations with 
services like [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/) or
[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home).
Some additionally use [PMPro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/)
(\\$0-597/yr.)
for membership access, allowing the user to remove ads or the like; similar
functionality is sometimes implemented with [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/),
which is also frequently used to replace the “point” paywalls on chapters.[^fn2]
Community interaction, that is functionality traditionally offered via forums,
has at this point been completely superseded by [Discord](https://discord.com/)
servers, which offloads any overhead onto the users via “server boosts.” Of
course, comments on the site itself are supported by WordPress plugins, such as
[WPDiscuz](https://wpdiscuz.com/) (\\$0). Then there’s domain names, a few 
of the LightNovel themed ones seem to be using
[Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/1) (\\$10.99-25.99/mo.) as both registrar and WordPress host, but you can generally
get a decent domain for about \\$30/yr. otherwise. All in all, I’d guess 
the actual site overhead is somewhere between \\$50-150/mo. So what about 
paying translators? They probably do some amount of that, given that a lot of 
the translators are actually just neural networks with their own subscription 
costs.

A couple months ago, I loaded about \\$3 for SFACG points so I could keep 
up with
[_Is It Weird for a Guy to Apply to a Witch School?_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/is-it-weird-for-a-guy-to-apply-to-a-witch-school/)
(身为男生志愿填魔女学院很奇怪吗 \[10/10\]) and after unlocking two chapters a
day amounting to something around 150 chapters I still haven’t burned through it
all. If we convert that 2-3¢ from USD to RMB it’s about 14-21¢, but that’s just
forex markets talking. Actual cost of living, by my estimate, would be best to
convert that to about 10¢, assuming the author gets about 40% that’s 4¢ per
reader per chapter. They upload twice a day[^fn3] with a minimum of 1k
readers,[^fn4] which amounts to about \\$80/day. You could probably live 
off that, no? None of that money comes from translations, though! Point is that 
if someone is charging you 15¢ for their ChatGPT translation why not just spend 
2¢ and Google Translate the original chapter? So that’s how I’ve been reading 
series I actually want to keep up with.

[_Kabushikigaisha Magilumiere_](https://anidb.net/anime/18292) (株式会社マジルミ
エ) is a magical girl anime, adapted from a
[manga](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/d5jvvlu/kabushiki-gaisha-magilumiere),
about Sakuragi Kana, a recent graduate struggling to find a job until she finds
herself entangled with the titular magical girl startup. It’s one of the more
modern magical girl setups where being a magical girl is simply one of many
career options. I have read a number of these, such as
[_In Order to Repay the Debt, I Became a Magical Girl_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/in-order-to-repay-the-debt-i-became-a-magical-girl/)
(为了还债我成为了魔法少女 \[8/10\]),
[_As if I’d Ever Be a Magical Girl_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/as-if-id-ever-be-a-magical-girl/)
(我才不是魔法少女 \[6/10\]), and
[_Ore to Hero to Mahou Shoujo_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/7k7q67r/ore-to-hero-to-mahou-shoujo)
(6/10)… obviously, I do like the gender-bender ones. Anyway, AniDB recommends
[_Miss Kuroitsu from the Monster Development Department_](https://anidb.net/anime/16425)
(怪人開発部の黒井津さん \[7/10\]) as a similar series, girls at work but the
work is magic. I do like girls at work,
[_Shirobako_](https://anidb.net/anime/10779) (9/10) is one of my favorite anime,
but I just can’t seem to get into this one despite the fact that the opening is
sung by Mafumafu! So, putting it on hold at ep. 2 with maybe a tentative 5/10?

[_There’s No Freaking Way I’ll Be Your Lover, Unless…_](https://anidb.net/anime/19001)
(わたしが恋人になれるわけないじゃん, ムリムリ! (※ムリじゃなかった!?)) is a yuri
anime, adapted from a light novel, about a girl who’s never had friends before
struggling to distinguish between a best friend and a girlfriend. I watched up
to ep. 4 with my wife the other day and she made a comment about it being rare
to see yuri where it’s actually hurts seeing them kiss. She immediately
corrected herself that [_Citrus_](https://anidb.net/anime/12545) (5/10) is much
the same way, interrupting my attempt to introduced her to
[_How I Lose Bets with My Sadistic Gifted Childhood Friend and She Steals All of My Firsts_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/e8rf9ox/shouwaru-tensai-osananajimi-to-no-shoubu-ni-makete-hatsutaiken-o-zenbu-ubawareru-hanashi)
(性悪天才幼馴染との勝負に負けて初体験を全部奪われる話 \[6/10\]). I don’t really
have much to say about the series, it’s just yuri. I tried reading the novels
once while on a plane, I think I got most of the way through the first volume?
It’s alright, 6/10.

I’ve been thinking a lot about number sequences lately. For context, a while ago
the power in the Seattle area went out for like a week, right? During that time
I didn’t really have consistent internet access, so when I did get a connection
I immediately sought to copy my wife: downloading a collection of mini-games so
I could play Water Sort. This isn’t about water sort, the specific collection,
called
[Offline Games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JindoBlu.OfflineGames&hl=en_US),
includes a Flappy Bird inspired game called Flappy Jump.

Unlike Flappy Bird, which sees the player hopping through gaps in vertical
walls, Flappy Jump’s gameplay is of a winged basketball jumping through hoops.
There are additional obstacles: changes in the hoops’ orientations, moving
hoops, hoops that require jumping up through them, and hoops whose rims are
covered in instant-death saw blades. To balance all that out, the game does
occasionally provide one-time use shields and, more important to my thoughts
here, bonuses for consecutively hopping through the hoops without touching the
rims (termed “splash”).
{:.no-indent}

The first “splash” provides the player with $2$ points rather than the default
$1$ point acquired from each hoop. Each “splash” thereafter adds $1$ to the
number of points it gives, e.g. the second splash is $3$ points, the third is
$4$ points, and the fourth is $5$ points. The number of points given for
“splash” $n$ is then $n+1$, so we can express this as a sequence where
$a_n = n + 1$, essentially counting up the integers with an offset of one.
Compare this then to the sequence of points gained without a “splash,”
$a_n = 1$, and you can see that it’s definitely more efficient! Let’s consider
then the number of points gained after $n$ “splash”es by adding together the
terms:
{:.no-indent}

$$
\begin{align}a_n&=\sum_{i=2}^{n}i=2+3+4+\cdots+n\tag{1a}\\
&=(2,5,8,12,17,23,30,38,45,55,\ldots)\tag{1b}\end{align}
$$

Interesting to be sure; however, if you check OEIS, you’ll find it isn’t even a
known sequence! I mean, that isn’t necessarily a problem, but it does mean
there’s no fun facts out there already… or are there? Consider that we’re just
adding the integers in order, there has to be a sequence like that, right?
There’s factorial ([A000142](https://oeis.org/A000142)) for multiplying numbers,
so would there be one for adding if we started from $a_1 = 0$ instead of $2$?
Turns out, yes! They’re called “triangular numbers”
([A000217](https://oeis.org/A000217)):
{:.no-indent}

$$
\begin{align}a_n&=\binom{n+1}{2}=\frac{n*(n+1)}{2}=0+1+2+\cdots+n\tag{2a}\\
&=(0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,\ldots)\tag{2b}\end{align}
$$

Since OEIS provided us with such nice notations, we can easily apply the same
format to our little sequence by shifting the beginning from $a_n=0$ to $2$ by
simply adding to those $n+1$ terms:
{:.no-indent}

$$
\begin{align}a_n&=\binom{n+3}{2}=\frac{n*(n+3)}{2}\tag{3a}\\
&=\frac{1}{2}(n+3)(n+2)=\frac{1}{2}(n^2+5n+6)\tag{3b}\end{align}
$$

I took the liberty of expanding the formula out a bit there, just to give a
clear view of the fact that this is a parabola. It’s exponentially more
efficient! Anyway, in light of this, I decided to give myself a challenge mode
where I can only score with a “splash” and if I don’t “splash” then I just drop
the ball and lose. This is mathematically very exciting. If we were to express
our sequence in terms of the triangular numbers, $T(n)$, we would find that
$a_n = T(n+2) + 1$. What this means is that each potential score from
consecutively “splash”ing is only $1$ away from a triangular number, that $1$
then being provided by the final hoop where I missed the “splash!”

[_Solo Leveling Season 2: Arise from the Shadow_](https://anidb.net/anime/18576)
(俺だけレベルアップな件 -Arise from the Shadow-) is an urban fantasy anime
adapted from a Korean light novel or
[web manga](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/6z1uqw7/solo-leveling). It
follows a typical Korean urban fantasy setup of a modern day setting which has
somewhat recently been encroached by portals to other worlds or their own pocket
dimensions, simultaneously granting humans some fantastical power to challenge
them. The protagonist, Sung Jinwoo, is given a system to enable him to gain
further power, particularly in that most “hunters” upon awakening stagnate at
their initial level whereas Jinwoo is capable of leveling up by gaining
experience points in the “gates.” I have completed the manhwa, it’s only about
200 chapters, so I can review this as an adaptation: it’s alright, the opening
theme is better than season one’s and the action scenes are pretty excitingly
animated, 5/10. As a side note, for some reason it took me until watching the
Jeju Island raid arc animated to think about the optics of a South Korean “raid”
on Jeju, given the history of Korean occupation of the island. The history
between Korea and Japan, of course, makes the Japanese intervention throughout
the arc definitely more acceptable, where Japan is portrayed as a calculating
military rival attempting to use the raid to show their power while diminishing
the influence of Korea. Just questionable that it happens on Jeju.

[_How Could the Villainous Young Master Be a Saintess?_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/how-could-the-villainous-young-master-be-a-saintess/)
(恶役少爷怎么可能会是圣女?) is a gender-bender yuri possession-type _isekai_ web
novel about a guy becoming the male villain, Winnie Varelis, in a yuri VN.
Winnie is the last descendant of the goddess Varelis, his family traditionally
producing the church’s saintesses up until his great-grandmother. By his
grandparents’ generation they’d been expelled from the church, and with the
death of his parents the church went so far as to “reclaim” the artifacts of
previous saintesses from their manor. He’s characterized as a victim of
circumstance, pushed into villainy out of necessity for some powerful group.
With this reincarnation, however, he gains a system which requires him to earn
“virtue points” by either fulfilling the duties of his lineage (giving alms,
helping strangers, praying, &c.) or causing emotional fluctuations for the
heroines and protagonist of the “original” story; these “virtue points” then
unlock his inherited power… obviously that of the “saintess,” at which point
Winnie becomes Vanessa. It’s the sort of gender-bender setup where the main
character can more or less swap freely between identities as a man or woman, the
main motivation for the latter being some power rather than comfort in the role.
It reminds me a lot of
[_The Paranoid Elf Queen Turned Me Into Her Sister_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-paranoid-elf-queen-turned-me-into-her-sister/)
(被偏执精灵女王变成了她妹妹 \[5/10\]) as Vanessa is compelled to act “proper”
and meticulous about cleanliness, Winnie being able to switch to the Vanessa
form, and the desire to keep that form secret due to complex lore reasons.
Winnie’s turmoil over whether he possessed the character at the beginning of the
story or he simply awakened his past-life memories at the time also reminded me
more of
[_Fake Saint of the Year_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/fake-saint-of-the-year/)
(理想の聖女？残念、偽聖女でした！\[5/10\]), though there’s much less evidence of
it being the case here. It’s take on a class system, where people are limited by
their magic potential to choose a “Soul Armament” which becomes a permanent
basis for any skills they learn thereafter is fairly interesting, I suppose.
I’ve read up to ch. 103 so far and
it’s alright, I don’t really like class systems and I prefer my trans-ings of
gender to be less burdened by them all the more so, but the perspective as a
“villain” is interesting enough to keep it at the average 5/10 thus far.

Reading aside, I have been working on more world-building stuff, trying to come
up with other languages/scripts for regions outside of the main one I’ve already
figured out. This has thus far involved things like converting Japanese _kana_
to Kannada script (I’ve uploaded the PDF for that
[here](/supplements/kannadakana.pdf)) and matching Nüshu and
Xi-Xia (Tangut) characters to every Toki Pona word. All this weird linguistics
work and I still haven’t touched an etymology article… maybe I’ll do it when I
get bored of trying to read! Yeah! Also, it is officially the Minecraft[^fn5]
phase in my circle, so I might actually be busy with that instead.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:
    These are just the prices for Personal ($4/mo.), Premium ($8), and Business
    (50GB, $25/mo.), you can go up to $336.67/mo. or $4,040/yr. with Commerce
    and 350 GB storage. Additionally, there is the Enterprise option, but that’s
    even further out of expectation for these sites.

[^fn2]:
    Some translators completely replace all this infrastructure with a simple
    Patreon page. Again, the UI of Patreon is not very conducive to serialized
    content so this is what one might call a “bad move.”

[^fn3]:
    Two chapters a day is generally the recommended minimum for
    “published”/monetized series. During promotions, more chapters are expected,
    so the author usually writes, say, three chapters a day to keep one as a
    draft for future release.

[^fn4]:
    I think the minimum subscriptions to a series to get “published” is about
    1k.

[^fn5]:
    Having mentioned _two_ video games in the span of a week, I would like to
    claim the official title of “gamer cat” hereafter.
