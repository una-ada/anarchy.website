title: Calculating Heat Efficiency on Campus Using Infrared Imaging
tags: research paper infrared-imaging coauthored collaboration physics

**Abstract.** Using data collected with an infrared camera, a mean external
temperature for any given building can be found and subsequently compared to
that of other buildings or the building’s own internal temperature. This data
gives a statistical basis for determining the heat efficiency of a building.

## Introduction

With the current pushes to maintain a green campus and common complaints about
certain buildings’ inconsistency in temperature, we decided that we would find a
way to explore just how much heat was lost by each building. The Physics
Department already had a FLUKE Ti45 in its possession, leading to the simple
conclusion that we could just point the infrared camera at the buildings and see
how hot the outsides were compared to the background temperature. So as to
reduce the amount of people that would interfere with our numbers and increase
the contrast between the buildings and the outside temperature, the study was
conducted over the course of January 2016. Due to the constraints of the
equipment, measurements could only be taken when the air temperature was greater
than 14°F, as such it was decided that the data should be collected with a
background temperature of 22°F. We collected data on six buildings: North Hall,
South Hall, Centennial Science Hall, the University Center, James H. Ames
Suites, and Prucha Hall.

## Methodology

In order to collect consistent data from building to building, images were taken
of each building in a manner that would attempt to cover the most amount of the
outside of the building while reducing overlap. This style is admittedly
imperfect and could contribute too many errors in the data.

Once the data was collected from the camera, it was organized into folders by
building. The camera recorded data as .is2 files (which are fairly standards
among infrared cameras) that we opened using Fluke’s SmartView 3.11. Once opened
in this program the images can be centered over the visible color images that
the Ti45 also recorded, and the spectrum used to display temperature was
standardized. For all images in this project we used the High Contrast settings,
with the minimum set to 16°F and the maximum to 70°F (this only effects the
coloration of the photos, not the collected data). Once the images are
standardized were then be exported in bulk as .csv files, which are all then
saved in the same folders as the pictures

The analysis of this data was done using Origin 2016. To begin with, we imported
all the .csv files from a particular building. In each of these files, which are
then considered worksheets within Origin, we removed the header data. This data
is used to define the position of each pixel, which we did not use as part of
our analysis. Each worksheet’s columns were then stacked, creating a single
column worksheet. All of these worksheets were then appended together (selecting
only column B(Y) in the appending dialog), and this resulting worksheet’s
columns then stacked as well.

This single column worksheet is what we considered our data set. A histogram
could be made from this set at this point, which is what we considered the
“complete” data. However, this data included quite a few points from the
background of the pictures, which created a noticeable bump on the histogram.
This means that there were two bumps on a complete data histogram: the first
being around the mean background temperature, the second being the mean
temperature of the building itself. To focus the results and find a statistical
mean, we truncated all the data in the column below a specific temperature. We
chose 26°F as the standard cutoff point, in most of the histograms we saw early
on, this was the point at which the first bump ended and the second began.
Histograms that this was done to are labeled “Truncated below 26°F” (some graphs
may have used a different cutoff point and are labeled respectively). A normal
curve fit was applied to these histograms to visualize their general spread.

## Results

For each building we compiled the truncated data into a histogram with a bin
size automated by Origin (typically 2°F). We also calculated means and standard
deviations of the truncated data. We can then use these values to graph a normal
curve for each building, which is then plotted over the respective histogram. To
create a readable comparison between each of the buildings, these normal curves
can be graphed together, as seen in Figure 1.

**FIGURE 1.** The normal curves derived from the data collected from each
building graphed atop each other to give a general idea of how each building’s
temperature compares. The probability here represents the percentage of points
(after truncations) in the data that measured a given temperature.

The amount of pictures taken varies significantly by building, this is mainly
due to the size and complexity of each structure. As such, knowing the amount of
images could be useful in interpreting the data collected. This could possibly
be used to calculate an uncertainty value on the measured temperatures, but for
our purposes we will simply be using an estimate made by comparing the
variations in the surrounding air temperature. The statistics for the data
collected from each building are in Table 1.

Building|Number of Points|Truncation Point|Mean|Std Dev
:-----|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
North Hall|435,309|26,692|36.5°F|5.3°F
South Hall|188,896|22,305|33.8°F|4.3°F
Centennial Science Hall|854,305|9,576|36.8°F|5.2°F
University Center|528,715|28,086|41.3°F|5.8°F
James H. Ames Suites|359,401|5,400|36.0°F|3.8°F
Prucha Hall|123.354|30,247|37.6°F|4.8°F

**TABLE 1.** The number of points in this table is the amount of pixels
collected from each picture of a given building; the truncation point is then
the amount of points removed when clearing out the background of the images.

### North Hall

We began the data collection with North Hall due to the simplicity of the
building’s layout, which can be approximated as a rectangle. This was also the
building whose internal temperature inconsistency inspired this project. To give
a decent overlook of the building’s data, we can use the histogram created from
the combination of all its images, as seen here in Figure 2.

![North Hall Histogram](/assets/img/cheocuii/northHall_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 2.** A histogram of North Hall’s data after all points below 26°F were
removed. The number atop the normal curve denotes the value of the mean. The
scale would appear unintuitive due to dead pixels on the IR camera recording
significantly higher temperatures than the actual value.

{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 3.** As a general comparison of what factors contributed to the data,
we can compare an image of the west side of North Hall (a) with one from the
east (b). The east appears much more crowded and cool, whereas the more open
area on the west side appears much warmer, including the noticeable area of the
background air.
{: .content__figure}

Given that the air temperature at the time was approximately 24°F, we find a
difference of 12.5°F between the air and the building’s mean temperature. We
could not determine any usable control measurements for this data. However, this
data can be compared to that of other buildings or used to analyze specific
locations on the building.

When measuring temperature using infrared, it is paramount to note the amount of
interference we can get from the area surrounding the building we want to
measure. Much of this interference can be attributed to the inherent properties
of heat, whereas taking measurements in a warmer area will make whatever is
being measured look warmer. This effect is quite noticeable for buildings, such
as North Hall, whose sides are in different types of environments, as seen in
Figure 3. The west side of the building is facing a large, open parking lot,
with a lot of exposure to the sun and surrounding environment. On the other
hand, the east side faces a much smaller lot, decorated with tree and otherwise
surrounded by a residential area where it would be exposed to light and heat
much less.

### South Hall

The next building to be measured was South Hall, which is directly across the
street from North Hall. South Hall ended up having the lowest mean temperature
of the six buildings that we measured. It should also be noted that this
building had the second least amount of data measured. Figure 4 contains a
histogram of all the images collected of South Hall after truncation.

![South Hall Data](/assets/img/cheocuii/southHall_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**Figure 4.** A histogram of South Hall’s data after all point below 26°F were
removed. Again the mean temperature is listed above the peak and the scale is
skewed to the right due to the dead pixels.
{: .content__figure}

From our data giving a mean temperature of 33.82°F and the reading of the
temperature of the air being recorded at 24°F, we found a difference of 9.8°F.
Again it should be stressed that keeping the picture as clear of foliage and
other obstacles is paramount to getting accurate results of the building’s heat
emission.

### Centennial Science Hall

Continuing off of South Hall we have Centennial Science Hall (CSH) which is
towards the middle of campus just North East of the University Center. CSH had
the lowest number of truncated data points and the highest number of total data
points, this gives us the highest number of usable points for a building. This
was due to the size of the building and the odd shape compounded with having
photos taken at a closer distance than the rest of the buildings.

![Centennial Science Hall Data](/assets/img/cheocuii/centennial_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 5.** A histogram of CSH’s data with all the points below 26°F removed,
again most of the skewing of the scale is from the dead pixels but more of the
skew is from actual data points than the previous buildings.
{: .content__figure}

From our data we got a mean temperature of 36.79°F and the recorded air
temperature being 22°F giving a difference of 14.79°F. Here we start to see the
patterns of heat loss from windows and heat vents both of which are expected but
they do emit a significant amount of heat that can be used to keep the building
warm for longer.

### University Center

For the largest building we measured we looked at the newest building, the
University Center (UC). A building that was built with the premise of being
ecofriendly while being functional. Some points that should be made before
showing any results are that the UC was measured during late January, a time
when the University is preparing for the Spring semester to start and thus
opening the main building on campus to people and use again.

![University Center Data](/assets/img/cheocuii/UC_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 6.** A histogram of the University Center’s data with all points below
26°F removed, the skewing of this graph represents the data well since there
were points in the upper 70°s.
{: .content__figure}

From our data we got a mean temperature of 41.25°F and a recorded air
temperature of 22°F with a difference of 19.25°F. The University Center
exemplifies the use of windows and how they affect heat loss and absorb sunlight
and its energy. The UC also showcases the amount of heat expelled through heat
vents, this gives a better indication as to what a fully functioning building on
campus will look like during the winter months, compared to the hibernating
buildings such as James H. Ames Suites and Prucha Hall over J-Term.

### James H. Ames Suites

One of the newer buildings on campus, James H. Ames Suites (Ames) is similar to
the UC in being a green building. The time the measurement was taken was during
the middle of J-Term when few if any residents were staying inside, this allows
us to showcase what a hibernating building during J-Term will look like in terms
of heat efficiency. Overall this was the most consistent building as seen by the
relatively small standard deviation.

![James H. Ames Suites Data](/assets/img/cheocuii/ames_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 7.** A histogram of Ames with all points below 26°F removed, overall a
tighter Gaussian distribution than the other buildings with the same skewing due
to the dead pixels.

{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 8.** The figure above shows the relative uniformity to Ames (a) and how
there is still some variation as seen in (b). This overall trend can be seen in
other hibernating buildings around campus.
{: .content__figure}

From our data we got a mean temperature of 36.02°F and a recorded air
temperature of 22°F with a difference of 14.02°F. Ames showed a similar
construction style to the UC and it had heat loss in similar areas, with large
bays of windows pointed southwest to let sunlight inside. Over all Ames was the
quieter of the two hibernating buildings measured which can be partially
attributed to the time when it was measured.

### Prucha Hall

Prucha Hall (Prucha) is one of the more classic style dormitories on campus,
because of this we can approximate it to most of the dorms found on the west
side of campus (Johnson, Stratton, and May Hall). The time that Prucha was
measured was the same day as the UC and thus was being warmed up for use again.

![Prucha Hall Data](/assets/img/cheocuii/prucha_hist.png)
{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 9.** A histogram of Prucha with all data points below 26°F removed,
with an accurate scale since there were some higher temperatures near the level
that the dead pixels were registering at.

{: .content__figure}

**FIGURE 10.** Photo (a) shows the massive heat loss from a heat vent and a
window on the top floor along with the heat escaping a steam tunnel. Photo (b)
shows the heat loss from the North windows is fairly low compared to the South
windows.
{: .content__figure}

From our data we got a mean temperature of 37.56°F and a measured air
temperature of 22°F which is a difference of 15.56°F. This ended up being the
second hottest building measured, some of which can be attributed to the
contamination of the steam tunnel access portal and the rest from poor
insulation in the walls. Given how the walls on most of the building ended up
being a greenish blue to dark green, compared to the darker blues and purples of
the surrounding environment, this is pretty obvious to being an insulation issue
from the original construction.

## Discussion

This method of collection and analysis does not give us any concrete conclusion
as to the efficiency of each building. We merely gain a simple comparison
between the amounts of heat lost, and a few noticeable areas of larger heat
loss. Theoretically, this data could be compared to the energy and heating costs
of each building to find some coefficient that would be indicative of said
building’s efficiency.

Another way by which this research may be expanded may be to do the same study
on all of the buildings on campus, and perhaps eventually to do so with other
campuses. This, of course, would be much more reasonable to carry out if such a
coefficient for the efficiency is found. It would also help the study if a more
efficient means of analyzing the data is found, such as a program that can
stitch all the photos taken into one.
