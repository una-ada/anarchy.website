Across the [Kii Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kii_Channel) from the
[previously discussed Kii Peninsula](https://anarchy.website/kinokuni) sits the
city of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto,_Tokushima)
([鳴門市](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80%E5%B8%82)).
Certainly, I’ve seen this a number of times before; yet, whilst trawling a map
solely for the sake of contextualizing toponyms, it piqued my
etymological curiosity. As that is also the name of a popular manga and its
titular protagonist, questions of whatever connection there may or may not be
between the city and the series will inevitably arise. Such questions are what I
had set upon answering for myself and my beloved readers, a process that by all
rights ought to have been so straightforward as to barely even justify the word
count that now lay before you. Yet! An immediate and unannounced hiatus
descended upon this article series as my attempts to articulate the necessary
information spiraled into absolute disaster.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

From the outset, I did have some idea of the origin of _Naruto_’s title courtesy
of my wife. She said it comes from the fish cakes,
[_narutomaki_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narutomaki)
([鳴門巻き](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80%E5%B7%BB%E3%81%8D)),
and I’m inclined to believe her. Mind you, I wouldn’t simply say so by virtue 
of her being my wife. I was skeptical at first. My nigh
hubristic academic pride oozes incredulity in the face of trivia regarding the
myriad cartoons of the aughts. In common parlance, I’m a slut for a citation
and, despite manga’s common perception as ‘nerd shit,’ everyone who talks about
this is so withholding. Thus our journey to track down a source begins. Having
been cockblocked[^fn1] by [Enkidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkidu),[^fn2]
I must befriend and travel with him to the
[Cedar Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Forest) whereupon I shall
slay the demigod [Humbaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humbaba) and achieve
glory!

Y’know, it does seem _a bit_ pretentious to regard Wikipedia as the Cedar
Forest, actually; especially when the metaphorical battle with Humbaba is then
discovering that neither the page for
[_Naruto_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) nor that for
[Uzumaki Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki) contained any
discussion on the etymology. After that, uh, Pyrrhic victory, I shall fell but a
single cedar: _Naruto_ was originally slated to be a cooking manga.[^fn3] I’ll
hew this timber later,[^fn4] to keep the original chronology of my
research.[^fn5]
{:.content__p_noindent}

For now, I shall return to [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk), by which
I mean I decided to see if [Pixiv Dictionary](https://dic.pixiv.net/) would be
more helpful. The article for
[_Naruto_ (NARUTO)](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/NARUTO) certainly was not, but the
one for
[Uzumaki Naruto (うずまきナルト)](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%81%86%E3%81%9A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%8D%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88)
did at least include the etymology within the series canon. In the text,
Naruto’s father, Namikaze Minato (波風ミナト), named him after the main
character of one of [Jiraiya](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiraiya_(Naruto)>)
([自来也](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/NARUTO_-%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88-%E3%81%AE%E7%99%BB%E5%A0%B4%E4%BA%BA%E7%89%A9#%E8%87%AA%E6%9D%A5%E4%B9%9F))’s
novels; a name which Jiraiya claims to have “randomly \[come\] up with while
eating ramen.”[^fn6] This would imply that, in the canon at least, the name
_does_ come from fish cake, a common ramen topping. Still, I’m not satisfied
with mere induction.
{:.content__p_noindent}

A different approach then. I’ll check the article for the name
‘[鳴門](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80)’ and... oh? Do mine eyes
deceive me or is that truly the goddess
[Ishtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna), Queen of Heaven, herself?
‘Naruto’ is a _sex position_ you say? You know what’s cooler than comic books?
Sex. We obviously have to talk about this before we move on to anything else.
See, the difference between Gilgamesh and me is that I would 100% fuck
Ishtar.[^fn7]

The article does not outright state that _naruto_ is a sex position at first,
instead it says that _naruto_ is one of the 48 Techniques (四十八手,
_sizyûhatte)_[^fn8] and that this is discussed more later on. Indeed, further
along there is more information, which is how I know that they are referring to
a sex position, but that does leave the very curious question of why ‘one of the
48 Techniques’ would imply such a thing. I’ll spare recounting the process of
uncovering this at length as it is not only a key component of this entire
article’s calamitous history but also lacking in enough English-language sources
for me to describe any information with due detail or confidence. Originally, in
the [Muromachi period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muromachi_period)
([室町時代](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%A4%E7%94%BA%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3),
_muromati zidai_), a list of decisive moves in
[sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo)
([相撲](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%B8%E6%92%B2), _sumô_) was dubbed
the 48 Techniques, likely because the number is auspicious rather than a literal
enumeration of the techniques therein.[^fn9] Later, in the
[Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period)
([江戸時代](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%9F%E6%88%B8%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3),
_edo zidai_), the early [_ukiyoe_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e)
([浮世絵](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%AE%E4%B8%96%E7%B5%B5)) artist
[Hishikawa Moronobu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hishikawa_Moronobu)
([菱川師宣](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8F%B1%E5%B7%9D%E5%B8%AB%E5%AE%A3))
drew
[_Koi no Mutugoto Sizyûhatte_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shunga_depicting_48_positions_of_sexual_intercourse%EF%BC%88Tokozumoushizyuhatte%EF%BC%89.jpg)
(恋のむつごと四十八手) representing couples engaged in the expected number of
positions with annotations for each. The prevailing theory is that this work is
the origin of the 48 techniques of sex rather than of sumo;[^fn10] my personal
extension to the theory is that the work was a very funny parody of the sumo
concept, though setting any number of things to 48 was in vogue at the
time.[^fn11] Thereafter, the list would have any number of additions, frequently
being split front (表, _omote_) and back (裏, _ura_) for a combined length of 96
Techniques (九十六手, _kyûzyûrokute_) such as the list given by
[Pixiv Dictionary](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/48%E6%89%8B).
{:.content__p_noindent}

Anyway, _naruto_. The position is described as being an act of femdom
([女攻め](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E5%A5%B3%E6%94%BB%E3%82%81), _onna
seme_),[^fn12] though Pixiv Dictionary does also use more generalized
terminology:
{:.content__p_noindent}

> “From a position of sitting back \[onto their partner\], the ‘receiver’ is
> said to swing their hips, gyrating ‘like the Naruto whirlpools.’”

You may note the imagery of the
[Naruto whirlpools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_whirlpools)
([鳴門の渦潮](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E6%B8%A6%E6%BD%AE),
_Naruto no uzusio_) used here, bringing us all the way back around on this
tangent.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The [Naruto Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Strait)
([鳴門海峡](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80%E6%B5%B7%E5%B3%A1),
_Naruto Kaikyô_), on which the city Naruto sits, connects the
[Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean) to the
[Seto Inland Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seto_Inland_Sea)
([瀬戸内海](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%80%AC%E6%88%B8%E5%86%85%E6%B5%B7),
_Seto Naikai_) via the Kii Channel. With its 1.5km span, the current effected by
a 1.5m difference in sea level during tides reaches up to 15km/h (about 9mph for
the cool kids), inevitably spawning a number of whirlpools throughout. These
vortices then generate more than their share of noise, giving the strait its
name: roaring
([鳴る](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E3%82%8B#Japanese), _naru_)
gate ([門](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%96%80#Japanese), _to_).

The origin of the strait’s name is interesting, but it’s the things named after
the strait that are important here. For instance, the city is obviously named
after the waterway it’s on. The bridge spanning the strait’s width is the
876m[^fn13] long suspended
[Ōnaruto Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cnaruto_Bridge)
([大鳴門橋](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E9%B3%B4%E9%96%80%E6%A9%8B),
_Oonaruto Kyô_), which likely inspired the Great Naruto Bridge (鳴門大橋,
_Naruto Oohasi_) in the _Naruto_ series.[^fn14] The minor planet
[94356 Naruto](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=94356),
discovered Aug. 28, 2001, by
[Akimasa Nakamura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akimasa_Nakamura)
([中村彰正](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%9D%91%E5%BD%B0%E6%AD%A3),
_Nakamura Akimasa_) at
[Kuma Kogen Astronomical Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma_Kogen_Astronomical_Observatory)
([久万高原天体観測館](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%87%E9%AB%98%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%93%E8%A6%B3%E6%B8%AC%E9%A4%A8),
_Kumakôgen Tentaikan Sokukan_) was named after the strait. That one isn’t
relevant, I just thought it’s neat.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The fishcake
([蒲鉾](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%92%B2%E9%89%BE#Japanese), _kamaboko_)
with the swirl of pink, _narutomaki_, took on the name of the strait with the
addition of an emphatic _maki_
([巻き](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B7%BB%E3%81%8D#Japanese), _usu._
[まき](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%BE%E3%81%8D#Japanese)), meaning
‘winding.’ Fans of [Junji Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito)
([伊藤潤二](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E8%97%A4%E6%BD%A4%E4%BA%8C),
_Itô Zyunzi_) may be excitedly realizing that this _maki_ is the same _maki_
that forms part of _uzumaki_
([渦巻き](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B8%A6%E5%B7%BB%E3%81%8D), _usu._
[うずまき](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%86%E3%81%9A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%8D#Japanese)),
meaning ‘spiral,’ which is the title of
[one of his works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzumaki). _Uzumaki_ is, of
course, also Uzumaki Naruto’s family name in _Naruto._ This all gives us the
connection from the city of Naruto, to the strait, then to _narutomaki_, so
there’s just one more gap to bridge.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Remember that timber I left laying around? The idea that _Naruto_ was originally
meant to be a cooking manga? It’s finally time to hew that into lumber. The
Wikipedia article backs this up with a reference to an interview with
[Kishimoto Masashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masashi_Kishimoto)
([岸本斉史](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B2%B8%E6%9C%AC%E6%96%89%E5%8F%B2))
conducted by Wada Atsushi (和田篤志). To verify this citation, I needed to track
down a copy of
[_Naruto: Kizuna: The Words That Bind---Heaven Scroll_](https://naruto-official.com/en/books/5)
(NARUTO --ナルト-- 名言集 絆 --KIZUNA-- 天ノ巻) where the interview was
published. This did prove rather difficult for a time, but after giving up on
finding scans and/or translations of the full book, I stumbled upon some forum
threads that included translations of just the interview. So, here’s what
Kishimoto had to say regarding the origins of the manga:[^fn15]

> “At first, I was going to draw a cooking manga. It was also a ramen manga. It
> was about a boy who makes ramen and the main character’s name was Naruto.
> \[...\] The only thing I inherited from the beginning was the name.”

When I first started looking for this excerpt, I was hoping that, in combination
with the text, I could at least construct a convincing argument for the
_implication_ that _Naruto_ is named after fishcakes. But it turns out that Wada
followed up with the exact question I’ve wanted to ask:[^fn16]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> Wada: “Did the name Naruto literally come from the ramen topping?”<br/>
> Kishimoto: “Yes. I really liked ramen at the time, there was a ramen shop I
> used to go to in front of my university, and the name of that shop was
> ‘Ichiraku.’”

It was right there the whole time! Good job, Wada! My wife was right! Plus 
there’s a little thing about the name of the ramen shop in the series, that’ll 
certainly make someone in the audience happy!
{:.content__p_noindent}

The end... please? I’m never writing another one of these about manga. This one
was way too long, I had to cut out so many fun geography facts. The next word on
my list will also probably ruin me.

    The first word to come to mind here was actually
    ‘[blue-balled](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blue-ball),’ but I do think
    that’s both cringe and slightly incorrect. In a moment of writer’s block, I
    had to use the one dictionary that would actually assist in finding a more
    fitting word: Wiktionary. My point is that I then discovered that
    ‘[cockblock](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cockblock)’ was originally AAVE
    in the ‘70s, which is mildly interesting.

    You’ll notice that I’m using _nihonsiki_ romanization today, because I’m
    feeling spicy.

    [Hepburn romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization)
    would write じゅ as _ju_ since the
    [voiced alveolar fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_fricative)
    /z/ is palatalized when preceding the
    [close front unrounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel)
    /i/, or its semivocalic equivalent
    [voiced palatal approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_palatal_approximant)
    (yod) /j/, such that /zj/ is realized as the
    [voiced alveolo-palatal affricate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolo-palatal_affricate)
    \[d͡ʑ\] which is most easily approximated by English speakers as the
    [voiced postaveolar affricate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)
    \[d͡ʒ\] and thus written as ⟨j⟩. In contrast,
    [_Nihonsiki_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki_romanization) does
    not alter its spelling for
    [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone), such that /z/ is
    always written as ⟨z⟩, regardless of
    [palatalization](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics)>)
    (/zi/ \> \[ʑi\]),
    [affrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate#Affrication) (/zi/ \>
    \[d͡ʑi\]), and/or yod-coalescence (/zjuː/ \> \[d͡ʑɯː\]). This system then does
    not enforce the aforementioned processes as they have been realized in
    [“Standard” Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_dialect) upon the
    [various regional dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects)
    of the language
    [which may not have realized them as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsugana).

    I finally manage to put any amount of effort into learning Japanese.

    Honestly, just looking at the article for the number

[^fn12]:
    Full disclosure, this statement may be a minor misapprehension on my part;
    _onna seme_ can, in some cases, seemingly be applied to MLM couples, and may
    not necessarily be best to literally translate as ‘femdom.’ However, this
    does appear to be for the sake of BL works and may not apply to real
    couples. The confusion there brought about by the dichotomy of
    [攻め](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E3%82%81) (_seme_) and
    [受け](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8F%97%E3%81%91) (_uke_). Like the
    English term ‘[top](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/top#Noun),’ _seme_ could
    mean either ‘[dom](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dom#English)’ or
    ‘[pitcher](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pitcher#English),’ thus a term
    where the receiving partner takes a dominant role would be termed _uke
    seme_, which is seemingly contradictory and likely to be avoided.

[^fn13]:
    Wikipedia calls this “one of the largest bridges in the world” despite it
    not even ranking in the top 50 for suspension bridges alone.

[^fn14]:
    This bridge is named in manga vol. 4 ch. 33 “The Hero’s Bridge!!” (英雄の橋
    !!, _Eiyû no Hasi!!_) and anime ep. 19 “The Demon in the Snow” (ザブザ雪に散
    る..., _Zabuza Yuki ni Tiru..._). I would go insane if I tried to find a
    citation for the author saying that the bridge is actually named after the
    real one, but it tracks, right?
