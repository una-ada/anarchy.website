## Included Mods

Most links in this table are shortened using [goo.gl](https://goo.gl) because a
lot of people's website and blogs have very long URLs and I like the source code
for these pages to be just as legible as the end result. You shouldn't need any
of these links other than for information about the mods, but it's convenient to
have all the licenses and download links in one place for liability or something
I don't know.

## Download

The modpack is currently hosted in a private Google Drive Folder, please ask for
it in the `#sandbox-games` channel.

## Installation

These instructions assume you own a legitimate copy of Minecraft and are using a
Windows OS. They may also be overly detailed, but for some reason a lot of the
buttons and options are not very intuitive.

1. Download the Minecraft launcher from [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net).
2. Run the launcher.
3. If you already have Minecraft 1.7.10 installed, skip to step 12. Select the
   "Launch options" tab from the top menu.
4. Click "(+) Add new."
5. Select "release 1.7.10" for "Version."
6. Click "Save."
7. Select the "News" tab from the top menu.
8. Click the "^" button adjacent to the "Play" button.
9. Select the configuration with the "1.7.10" subtitle.
10. Click "Play."
11. When the game finishes downloading and the main menu opens, close the game.
12. If you already have Forge for 1.7.10 installed, skip to step 25. Download
    the Forge installer from [minecraftforge.net](https://goo.gl/7nMG7R). Select
    the latest version (1.7.10 - 10.13.4.1614).
13. Run the installer.
14. Leave all the options on the installer at default and click "OK."
15. When the installer is finished click "OK" to close it.
16. Open the Minecraft launcher.
17. If you would like to use the default configuration created by forge, you can
    skip steps 17-22. Select the "Launch options" tab from the top menu.
18. Click "(+) Add new."
19. (Optional) Since you will actually be using this configuration to play, you
    may want to add a name in the "Name" field.
20. Select "release 1.7.10-Forge10.13.4.1614-1.7.10" (the exact version numbers
    may vary if you selected a different download from the Forge website) for
    "Version," it should be near the bottom.
21. (Optional) To add more than the default amount of RAM (1GB) to this
    configuration, toggle the switch next to "JVM Arguments," then change the
    "1" in "-Xmx1G" in the adjacent field to the desired amount of RAM in GBs.
22. Select the "News" tab from the top menu.
23. Click the "^" button adjacent to the "Play" button.
24. Select the configuration that you just created (or the "Forge" configuration
    if you skipped 17-22).
25. Download the modpack from the above section.
26. Using the run dialog (windows key + R) or the navigation bar in Windows
    Explorer, navigate to `%appdata%/.minecraft`.
27. Open the folder called `mods`, if it does not exist create it then open it.
28. Open the folder called `1.7.10`, if it does not exist create it then open
    it.
29. Copy the contents of the modpack's .zip file into the `1.7.10` folder.
30. (Optional) Download Optifine [here](https://goo.gl/G6nGWW) and move it into
    this folder as well.
31. Return to the launcher and click "Play." (assuming the previous
    configuration is still selected).

## Footnotes

[^1]:
    The CurseForge page for Baubles refers to the MineCraft Forum page as the
    main thread. This thread states "go wild" in reference to usage in modpacks,
    wheras the CurseForge page does include a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license which
    would also allow usage in modpacks so long as they are non-commercial and
    are released under a similar license.

[^2]: See "copyright.txt" in the mod's .jar file.
[^3]:
    Lucky Block could be included if this wasn't considered a "public modpack,"
    but having everything open and public is just easier than not doing so.
    Also, it could totally still be included if you don't respect "Australian
    Copyright Law", which... I mean...

[^4]:
    OptiFine's official description according to their website states that it
    cannot be redistributed, but you should probably download it yourself. It
    isn't absolutely necessary, however, since it is purely client side and does
    not affect servers.

[^5]:
    The author of Witchery _does_ allow it in modpacks _if_ you send them a
    private message on Minecraft Forum, but I'd have to find some way to
    reactivate my account or just register a new one to do that because I
    haven't touched it in like 6 years.

[^6]:
    Since we would still like to use these mods, but cannot do so in a public
    modpack, the modpack is only available via our private Google Drive links.

[^7]:
    The Portal Gun patch for PureBDCraft is only availabe in 128x and 64x:
    [here](http://bdcraft.net/community/pbdc-patches-rel/portal-gun-t298.html).

[^8]:
    The WIP Thaumic Exploration patch for PureBDCraft is only available in 512x:
    [here](http://bdcraft.net/community/pbdc-patches-wip/thaumic-exploration-t3755.html).
