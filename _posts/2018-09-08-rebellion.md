Everyone has *some* contrarian opinions, a prevalent example of this being to
claim that the Star Wars prequels were actually good. While I'm sure that I
have plenty of these opinions laying around myself, the one that always seems to
throw me off upon being reminded of it is that Madoka Magica is actually a
pretty decent show[^1]. Actually, I don't think there's much use in using such
weak wording here, I didn't just think it was "decent" I thought it was really
good to the point that I, whose average rating on [MyAnimeList][7] is
[4.95][8][^2], gave it a 9/10. If you look at [my list][5] you might even draw
the conclusion that I only gave it a 9 and not a 10 for essentially just not
being [Neon Genesis Evangelion][6].
{: .dropcap}

[^1]:   I begin to wonder whether or not the critiques of this show are even as
        common among the actual audience as they are among some niche group of
        reviewers, since according to [MAL][7] my high rating of 9 for the show
        is actually only 0.55 above the average. Now, it is a very distinct
        possibility that this is actually a very common critique, but that this
        disagreement over whether or not the show sufficiently meets the
        requirements for good genre subversion does not affect people's opinions
        on the show itself. If I'm to make the assumption that this is true,
        then I would have to make a correction to my earlier statement and say
        that my opinion is contrarian in that I believe that the show serves as
        a great example of genre subversion.

[^2]:   At the time of writing this I've rated 241 shows, with a mean rating of
        4.95 and a standard deviation of 1.82. See
        <https://graph.anime.plus/Trewbot/ratings,anime> for more details.

One might ask then "why did you like the show so much?" And a few might also be
compelled to ask why this is even a contrarian opinion. It'll be a lot easier to
address this latter question first, and to describe why I think a lot of the
critiques of this show are absolutely incorrect. Before I get into either of
these questions even, I'll go over the show a bit to provide some context. Of
course, if you ignored the spoiler warning at the top of the page, this is a
good time to put in a reminder that this post will contain a lot of spoilers for
the Madoka Magica series and movies; if you haven't seen them then *I guess* I
will basically be explaining the whole thing to you.

The show follows [Kaname Madoka (鹿目 まどか)][7] as she decides whether or not
she should accept the contract offered to her by [Kyuubey (キュゥべぇ)][8] to
become a magical girl. While contemplating this decision, she is encouraged by
her friend, [Miki Sayaka (美樹 さやか)][9], and an upperclassman who shows her
the life of a magical girl, [Tomoe Mami (巴 マミ)][10]; she is also discouraged
by the actions of [Akemi Homura (暁美 ほむら)][11], another magical girl who is
attempting to convince her not to accept the contract.

As a magical girl, it is a girl's responsibility to fight witches. A witch is
the manifestation of human despair, the create labyrinths that they trick people
into entering, where they are trapped and consumed. Fighting them is very
dangerous, as Mami points out to Madoka and Sayaka multiple times before
ultimately exemplifying this herself by dying in front of them; it is, however,
necessary for magical girls to defeat the witches both as the simply part of
their contract and due to the powers of the Grief Seeds that defeated witches
drop. A magical girl's power comes from her Soul Gem, but as she uses it this
becomes clouded, the only fix for which is to touch it against a Grief Seed.

The incentive to accept the contract, despite all this, is that you may
have a single wish granted. The power of such a motivator is shown by Sayaka as
she, despite seeing the death of Mami and the pain caused by being a magical
girl, becomes a magical girl herself to help the boy she likes.

It is at this point that we can begin to ask how exactly any of this differs
from other magical girl shows, what exactly about this show is subverting it?
The trivial answer is in the tone. For a more in-depth answer we must first
discuss the genre it is said to be subverting: what is a magical girl show?

While technically the only requirement to be of the magical girl genre is that a
show contains girls (and this is arguably not restricted by gender) that have
some magical powers, there are trends that become stereotypical across the
genre, as is typically the case. One such trend in the magical girl genre is
that there is some evil that is to be fought by these magical girls. Another is
that, especially since this is typically a genre intended for younger audiences,
the tone and framing of the magical girls' actions are that of graceful heroes
that enjoy saving the world from the aforementioned evil.

Madoka Magica subverts both of these quite well, which is admittedly why I chose
them as examples of trends in the genre. Firstly, the evil that is being fought
in the show is (spoilers) actually created by the magical girls themselves, they
are all trapped in a system where by fighting this evil they eventually become
that which they fight. It is through Homura's character that we are shown the
conclusion that those who created and maintain this system, the Incubators, are
the true evil that should be fought against.

Second, as the true nature of the Witches is revealed, the framing of the
actions of the magical girls is no longer necessarily that of heroism. This is
wherein the common critique that the show is using edginess as its entire basis
for genre subversion originates. The show does not present these girls as
graceful heroes, but as tortured souls. We are especially shown this through
Mami, who attempts to give off an air of majesty to give Madoka and Sayaka more
confidence in the work of a magical girl, but is in reality suffering due to the
difficulty of the work required of her. I will concede that there are points
where the show is definitely trying too hard to make this point, including some
lines that are quite "edgy."

_Finally,_ I can begin to get the point of this whole essay. In the end of the
show, after finding out the truth about the magical girl system, Madoka finally
decides to make a contract with Kyuubey. If a Soul Gem is not cleansed with a
Grief Seed it eventually clouds over completely and the magical girl becomes a
Witch. The Incubators (Kyuubey) use this system to harness the energy that is
released by this conversion, but as Madoka is empathetic towards the pain
experienced by the magical girls, her wish is to break this system such that the
magical girls do not become Witches.

"[Madoka] transcends not only the current system of magical girls but the
current universe itself..."
{: .pullquote .pullquote_left}

This wish creates what is then called the Law of Cycles (円環の理), a new system
embodied by Madoka herself. She transcends not only the current system of
magical girls but the current universe itself, rewriting it such that the
magical girls are not made to suffer as their Soul Gems are cleansed by the Law
of Cycles rather than becoming Witches. It is this idea that reminded me of the
essay "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus, in which Camus discusses the Greek
myth of Sisyphus and establishes the idea of accepting the absurd. Camus
describes the situation Sisyphus finds himself in, that of rolling a boulder up
a hill, watching it fall back down, and then repeating the process, as simply
the unchanging reality of Sisyphus, something that he can and must accept. This
is furthered by the fact that Sisyphus is not forced into this labor by chance
but rather as a consequence brought to him by the gods that he had infuriated.

If we substitute the rock for the Law of Cycles, the clever trickery against the
gods for the wish, and the gods for the Incubators, we can easily draw a
parallel between these two stories. We see that, just as Sisyphus was set to
eternally roll a boulder up a hill, Madoka is set to eternally purify those
magical girls who would turn witches.

Madoka is the absurd hero, she exists as a consciousness trapped in an unending
cyclical task as the result of her own actions. Because she chose this, we can
easily imagine her happy.

Homura, however, exists as the natural consequence of such a godly power
spawning from nothing: an opposing power. Rather than accept the absurdity, she
rewrites the fundamentals of that absurdity, abolishing it by its own first
principles.

What distinguishes Madoka from Sisyphus is that there exists a coercive force
that would, if he were to somehow manage to break free from his current state,
reestablish the status quo for Sisyphus, whereas no such thing exists for
Madoka. If anything, Madoka's position exists _in opposition_ to what may be
considered the gods in her story (the Incubators). Her situation exists as a
result of a fundamental shift in the rules of the universe, which indicates that
within the universe as is there is no possible change to it. However, if the
universe could be amended once, without any change to that which allowed the
amendment it could be amended once again.

That last assertion may actually be irrelevant here given the methodology by
which Homura alters Madoka's situation, but it indicates the possibility of such
an action within this universe. What Homura does is take advantage of the
separate existences of Madoka and the Law of Cycles, splitting them such that
they may exist exclusive of each other. In essence, we can view this as Homura
automating the Law of Cycles so that Madoka may live unburdened by its labor.
Therein lies the issue one must take with the Myth of Sisyphus, that while we
can accept the absurd (imagine Sisyphus happy) we can also in many cases alter
the absurd such that more people are allowed to be happy than just our
hypothetical Sisyphus.

While Madoka may be functionally similar to our absurd hero, she is not also
equivalent to our proletarian of the gods. This key difference is something that
Homura clearly takes advantage of. Since Madoka is not held in her position by
any higher power than herself, changes can be made to the principles defining
her position without also petitioning some higher power. The Myth of Sisyphus
may provide a perfect example of a situation whose horror is remedied simply by
embracing the absurd, Madoka Magica presents a situation that (while not wholly
realistic) analogs the sort of nuance that one would find in more realistic
situations.
