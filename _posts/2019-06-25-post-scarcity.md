## Introduction

-   C: _Good Sexitidi everyone, and welcome to part five (5) of Goth Angel
    Sinners, a podcast for jocks and goths about glocks and moths. I’m Chloe..._
-   U: _...and I’m Una..._
-   C: _Our small, British son will not be joining us today because he's too
    limey_
-   Some axioms for our discussion here:
    -   All people deserve to survive.
    -   Society exists for the mutual benefit of its members.
    -   We live in a society.
    -   _**Socially** usable_ resources are the product of human action, though
        resources by themselves exist in nature.

## Further Statements on "Society"

-   Society (which we live in) should ensure that all people can survive.
-   Humans, as members of society, can contribute the resources that they
    produce, allowing "society" the usage of them as a means to achieve the
    previous point. This is called the "commons," the collective resources of
    society.
-   The exact form of "society"'s will in this case would have to be enacted in
    some form: government, market, free distribution.[^a]
-   The former two possibilities while not necessarily inefficient are open to a
    significant amount of errors in their efficient operation: underestimate of
    need, overestimate of production, deliberate corruption, etc.[^b]

[^a]:   "Government" and "market" aren't necessarily different forms of
        distribution; markets don't have a tendency to form within societies
        absent the state, however trade between people as groups does.

[^b]:   This is guaranteed to happen because of bureaucracy (see: Scott, Seeing
        Like A State).


## Post-Scarcity _Anarchism_

-   Assuming that "what can go wrong will go wrong," i.e. the existence of a
    potential fault will at some point become an actual fault, then such a
    system will inevitably be riddled with inefficiencies and corruption.
    -   The former feeding into the latter as the impossibility of a purely
        efficient system will be used as an excuse to further the systemic
        enforcement of inefficiencies (such as the alteration of the metric of
        efficiency to begin with as seen with measures such as GDP and "poverty"
        which gerrymander the population to cover up various problems that would
        elsewhere be more negatively perceived).
-   As such we can explore the third means: free distribution, that is the open
    availability of all resources to be called upon by the consumers without any
    bar to entry.
    -   The negative consequences of which being the overconsumption of
        resources, essentially the overestimation of available resources without
        the action of a central authority but still the collective action of
        multiple consumers.
    -   Chuds believe that this is inevitable and screech "the tragedy of the
        commons" every time this is proposed, however this is wrong and common
        pool resources can frequently result in a "comedy of the commons" and
        there's also the fact that people can in fact talk to each other and
        figure out how to do things.
-   A post-scarcity society and anarchism necessitate each other because state
    systems are built around restriction and exclusion of access to necessary
    resources (water, food, land, shelter, etc. etc. etc.).
    -   One cannot have a general post-scarcity while a state exists because
        states require the exclusion of the majority of people from some
        necessity, and one cannot have a state while general post-scarcity
        exists due to the lack of exclusion/restriction, by definition.

## Is Post-Scarcity _Technically_ Feasible?

-   First, a clarification: abundance vs. post-scarcity.
    -   Having a bunch of shit doesn't necessarily mean having post-scarcity and
        having post-scarcity doesn't necessarily having unlimited everything.
    -   Post-scarcity is less about "having lots of stuff" and more about a
        social state of having access to all the resources necessary for the
        fulfillment of life.
    -   _If_ post-scarcity were dependent on abundance, then it would imply that
        post-scarcity and therefore anarchism could only occur at a certain
        level of production, however since people have volition and could in
        fact decide to stop doing hierarchy and do anarchy instead, this is
        clearly wrong (i.e. we could have done anarchism at any point in
        history, we aren't dependent on certain material conditions; fuck you,
        Marxists).
-   If, however, production is at or beyond the estimates of the consumers,
    which given modern production modes is a fair assumption, then this problem
    can be viewed as trivial.
    -   Food Production
        -   Somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of food produced globally is lost or
            wasted.
            -   This is entirely the fault of statism you cannot change my mind.
        -   See [Goth Angel Sinners Pt. I][1] for our opinion on our current
            method of getting products to consumers and how efficient it is.
        -   Cars are bad. Food production is useless without access and a car
            based infrastructure increases the bar for said access to those with
            access to the economic means by which to use the infrastructure.
        -   Much of[^c] cereal production is used for biofuels, which assume the
            usage of personal transport (i.e. cars) which rely on such fuels.
            Removing this sector of the production would decrease the necessary
            yield giving more room for seeking ecological means of production.
    -   Housing[^d]
-   Thus, we return to the issue of distribution, free distribution as opposed
    to our contemporary manner which restricts access thru economic and
    geographic barriers.
    -   Economics is meant as a field to manage the distribution of resources
        under the assumption that resources are either more scarce or precisely
        as scarce as demand; as this is based on prediction and estimate leaning
        towards underestimation, scarcity is "enforced" thru the deliberate lack
        of distribution to specific communities either due to their not meeting
        the expected conditions (production of wealth) or thru deliberate
        \[sanctioning?\], i.e. racism (see: food deserts).

[^c]:   We had trouble tracking down exact numbers and sources on this claim,
        but are nonetheless confident in this statement.

[^d]:   This sections was never written. Fuck you.

## Is Post-Scarcity _Socially_ Possible?

-   Uh... remember that like 195,000 years where we didn't have states and
    people had free access to resources and somehow managed to survive? Yeah,
    let's do that again but this time with trains.
-   Modern "Society"
    -   Free sharing of culture benefits creators and consumers, the only people
        who lose out are middlemen who otherwise contribute nothing except
        maintaining scarcity.[^1]
    -   A combination of government regulation and subsidies creates large
        unnecessary overhead costs, centralizing control of resources and
        increasing costs to consumers, further restricting access to them.[^2]
    -   State subsidies to things like large agribusiness promote centralization
        of control in the food system, towards things like monoculture,
        excessive use of pesticides, topsoil depletion, and resulting in food
        lacking in nutrition.[^3]
    -   Smaller farms would be more ecological, more productive, healthier, and
        be more inclined towards equitable distribution, but uh the state and
        capitalism exist instead.
    -   Patent system causes medical R&D to focus in simply tweaking old drugs
        just enough to be considered "new" so a new patent can be gotten for
        them.[^2]
        -   Haha, take that, people who believe capitalism creates "innovation"
            or whatever.
    -   "It's an overall process in which the state socializes operating costs
        and subsidizes inputs to make capital artificially profitable, and
        disaster capitalists seize on the resulting fiscal disaster to loot
        taxpayer-funded assets and subsequently gouge the public." &mdash;Kevin
        Carson.[^5]
    -   What if we just stopped spending resources on things that keep people
        from accessing resources?
        -   Abolish donuts
    -   As has been repeatedly emphasized, capitalism relies on restriction of
        access, this is most obviously done through the price system, but other
        forms of sabotage exist as well to restrict the flow of resources that
        ranges from planned obsolescence to the outright destruction of
        resources and infrastructure through war.

## Current Production Techniques/Consumption Habits are Killing the Planet and We Need To Do Things Better

-   Restoration Agriculture/Permaculture.
-   Green Energy:
    -   We can and should use things like wind, water, heat, and gravity
        directly as energy when possible; natural forces generally have less
        waste heat. Require less infrastructure, and outside of what little
        infrastructure may be necessary usually require next to no external
        resources that would be used to justify extractivist practices.
    -   Nuclear energy, see Neighbor Science 417.[^4]
    -   ~~Geothermal energy~~
    -   ~~Wind energy~~
    -   Socially, decentralized energy production would be best practice as it
        would not leave power (necessary for life in many areas and to quality
        of life in most) as a hierarchical resource that can be used for social
        stratification.
        -   Furthermore, demand estimates can be tailored to individual need,
            tho small regional (i.e. neighborhood) distribution networks can be
            utilized to ensure any excess produced is not lost unnecessarily.
        -   Centralized power stations may possibly still be used depending on
            the social landscape, especially when the management requires
            specialist handling (see nuclear) or the source of the power is a
            singular or remote geographic location (see geothermal or wind). In
            this case decentralized power production can be used to add
            redundancy to help avoid brownouts or rolling blackouts in areas
            where demand may peak (such as cities with intense heat waves).
-   Decentralization and Centralization
    -   Bookchin was wrong sprawl is bad.
-   Transit (Death to Cars)
    -   Trains, bruh.
