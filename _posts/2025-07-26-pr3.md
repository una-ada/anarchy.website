The other night, I had a dream that I had finished my next etymology article;
when I awoke, there was nothing but an outline and a bibliography. This was
greatly demotivating.
{:.dropcap}

[_Once Upon a Witch’s Death_](https://anidb.net/anime/18719)
(ある魔女が死ぬまで)
is a modern fantasy slice-of-life drama anime about Meg Raspberry, an
apprentice to Faust of the Seven Sages who was told on her 17th birthday that
she will die in a year. The one hope she has is to construct a seed of life by
collecting a thousand tears of joy, which conveniently sets up an episodic plot
of her helping people to solve problems and overcome worries; it’s similar to
[_Wandering Witch_](https://anidb.net/anime/15202) (魔女の旅々 \[7/10\]). Meg is
generally very optimistic, often giving situations a more comedic tone, despite
her impending death. In particular, she constantly proposed marriage to her best
friend Fine Cavendish, I like to think she’s bisexual (you can call her
interactions with Fine just friends messing around all you want, that scene
where she washed Inori’s feet isn’t going away). I watched the English dub and
it’s pretty well done, the voicing is spot on for the characters, especially
Meg’s constant energy and occasional perversion showing very well. The ending
theme slaps, the ending of the season doesn’t as much… big cliffhanger for her
grand journey around the world. Will this push me into reading the light novels?
I don’t know, does she kiss Fine in the novels?[^fn1] Anyway it was a fun watch
while doing chores and stuff so 6/10.

[_Isshun de Chiryou Shiteita no ni Yakutatazu to Tsuihou Sareta Tensai Chiyushi, Yami Healer to Shite Tanoshiku Ikiru_](https://anidb.net/anime/18528)
(一瞬で治療していたのに役立たずと追放された天才治癒師, 闇ヒーラーとして楽しく生
きる) is an anime about the coolest, hottest, strongest healer in the whole
country of healers, Zenos. He’s so cool that he isn’t even licensed as a healer;
he’s so hot he’s got a harem of orcs, werewolves, lizardmen, and elves from the
first episode; he’s so strong he can cast healing without incantations _and_
he’s a wicked good fighter. I turned on the first episode while I was folding
laundry, then turned it off when I was done. It has one of those premises where
some guy gets kicked out of the hero’s party because he’s “useless,” but in
reality it was just because they’re all shallow assholes. I don’t really care
for this setup, though I did manage to watch
[_Yuusha Party wo Tsuihou sareta Beast Tamer, Saikyoushu no Nekomimi Shoujo to Deau_](https://anidb.net/anime/17444)
(勇者パーティーを追放されたビーストテイマー、最強種の猫耳少女と出会う \[5/10\])
and dropped
[_Shin no Nakama ja Nai to Yuusha no Party wo Oidasareta node, Henkyou de Slow Life suru Koto ni Shimashita_](https://anidb.net/anime/15853)
(真の仲間じゃないと勇者のパーティーを追い出されたので、辺境でスローライフするこ
とにしました \[5/10\]) halfway through ‘cuz I got bored. I’ll give this the
benefit of the doubt at give this one a 3/10.

I finished catching up on
[_Forced to Sell Myself to the Female Lead After Killing the Male Lead_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/forced-to-sell-myself-to-the-female-lead-after-killing-the-male-lead/)
(干掉男主的我被迫把自己卖给女主) which I mentioned last time… turns out that the
story is finished now. That explains why the chapters were all from 2024 and
there weren’t many left, I was kind of worried that it would be on hiatus or
something, but the last arc definitely felt like a last arc.

[_Bocchi the Rock!_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ej3cita/bocchi-the-rock)
(ぼっち・ざ・ろっく) is a slice-of-life 4-_koma_ manga about the socially
anxious Bocchi (Gotoh Hitori) stumbling her way into joining a band. I realized
I’m pretty far behind on serialized manga lately, so I started off with a strong
note, catching up to ch. 89 of _BTR_. The anime covers Bocchi’s initial
inspiration for getting into music (wanting to join a band to become popular
despite her anxiety), the early formation of Kessoku Band (Nijika scouting
Bocchi as a substitute guitarist), and some of their early performances. I don’t
think it’s a spoiler to say the band becomes increasingly successful throughout
the series, so much of the later arcs are about signing to labels, working with
other bands and venues, and the changes in their daily lives as they graduate
school. Basically nothing earth-shattering has happened in the series lately,
but nobody told me that the series got a cover spot in an issue and the art was
Kita painting Bocchi’s nails? To quote my wife: “BoKita canon???” Anyway it’s
still a 10/10, plenty more questionably diegetic nervous reactions from our pal
Bocchi to be had.

[_Momoiro Montage_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/32ha11w/momoiro-montage)
(ももいろモンタージュ) is a slice-of-life manga about Tamamon (Tamaki Mone), an
erotic artist. The scanlations were on hiatus for a whole year now, so only two
of the four volumes were available; now, there’s one more chapter… anyway two
volumes is nothing so I reread it. The story takes place when she’s in art
school, following a sort of episodic format of her facing challenges in her art
and perspective with each assignment, kind of like
[_Blue Period_](https://anidb.net/anime/15993) (ブルーピリオド \[8/10\]) but
focused entirely on nude portraits. Tamamon’s relationship with Hina is, uhh,
well Tamamon obsesses over eroticism and Hina is, y’know? Willing? It’s pretty
well established how this all goes right from ch. 1. I really do hope the
translators manage to stick through the next couple volumes, I’ve read a bit of
the raws but it’s not like I’m actually literate in Japanese (to be fair like
70% of the dialogue is just エッチな this and スケベ that). I give it a 7/10.

[_I Want to Become a Beautiful Girl, Be Spoiled, and Live Life on Easy Mode!_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-want-to-become-a-beautiful-girl-be-spoiled-and-live-life-on-easy-mode/)
(美少女になってちやほやされて人生イージーモードで生きたい！) is a slice-of-life
gender-bender reincarnation web novel about a VTuber, like a Japanese version of
[_Basement-Dwelling Loser VTuber_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/basement-dwelling-loser-vtuber/)
(방구석 찐따 버튜버 \[5/10\]) that happens to be 3-4 years older. I came across
it once again because I opened up the NU page for
[_I Will Never Submit to Miss Grim Reaper_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-will-never-submit-to-miss-grim-reaper/)
(萝变的我绝不向死神小姐屈服 \[5/10\]), hesitated to re-read it, and looked at
the recommendations section; I _was_ a bit off-put by the mess of translations,
there’s like three different groups listed for the early chapters, then anything
past ch. 12 seems to have been purged because NU doesn’t allow pay-walled links
(if you expect me to read a web novel on Patreon you ought to get your brain
checked). I do have to wonder how much _Basement-Dwelling Loser VTuber_ derived
from this series, it has the same _komyusho_ (コミュ障, “communication
disorder”) protagonist with the same debuff of sharing the same class through
all three years of high school. The pacing feels a tad rushed, at least in the
initial setup of her becoming a VTuber, which I suppose is to be expected of a
web novel. The
[manga adaptation](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/euojex5/bishoujo-ni-natta-chiyahoyasarete-jinsei-easy-de-ikitai)
actually reads a lot smoother, but is sadly on hiatus after the first volume;
the addition of the art (which is very good) and the additional characterization
and relationships between characters shown at the beginning definitely make it a
more enjoyable experience than the web novel. So I’ll give the web novel a 4/10
at ch. 12 (if I liked it more I’d go read the rest on Syosetu) and the manga a
5/10 at ch. 5.

[_I Will Never Submit to Miss Grim Reaper_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-will-never-submit-to-miss-grim-reaper/?pg=27#myTable)
(萝变的我绝不向死神小姐屈服) is a slice-of-life gender-bender _yuri_ web novel.
Depending on your definition, it is _isekai_, particularly of the sort
[_NicoNicoPedia_](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E7%95%B0%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C) calls
異世界 → 現実もの (_isekai \> genzitu mono_, “other world to reality”)[^fn2]
like [_The Devil is a Part-Timer!_](https://anidb.net/anime/9466) (はたらく魔王
さま！\[5/10\]) or [_Gabriel Dropout_](https://anidb.net/anime/12290) (ガヴリー
ルドロップアウト \[6/10\]). I’d previously read up to ch. 315 but the series is
completely translated now so I’m rereading from the start to finish it. What I
mainly think about this series is that it has vibes. I mean, it _is_
slice-of-life, but I think it just does it particularly well. Most of the plot
is about Yin Nuo’er making ends meet while having the “grim reaper” Yin Xiamo
clinging to her the whole time. It’s full of coincidences, like when she’s
looking for a new apartment and finds someone looking for a roommate only to
find out that the listing was posted by her former editor. Then there’s the
whole reason Xiamo popped up to claim Nuo’er “died” and then turned her into a
girl, all being tied to events in the other world and Nuo’er’s past life as the
“hero.” Read up to ch. 122 this time, just not the vibe at the moment.

[_The Apothecary Diaries (2025)_](https://anidb.net/anime/18562) (薬屋のひとりご
と) is a historical detective drama about Maomao, the adopted daughter of an
apothecary, being sold into the imperial court, working her way up to a trusted
lady-in-waiting to Concubine Gyokuyō, then helping the administrator Jinshi
solve various oddities throughout the rear palace. The second season has been
completely dubbed in English, so I can watch it as I did the
[first season](https://anidb.net/anime/17870) \[8/10\]: in the background while
working on stuff. I don’t know if my memory of the first season is just
rose-tinted, but I feel like there’s a significant dip in animation quality
here. Particularly, there’s the common issue of consistency in the characters’
faces, especially in daily life scenes that likely get less attention. If you
want a sort of similar setting
[_Raven of the Inner Palace_](https://anidb.net/anime/17038) (後宮の烏), which I
never finished, also takes place in a Chinese palace, but it is a bit heavier on
the romance. The recommendations on AniDB also list
[_Snow White with the Red Hair_](https://anidb.net/anime/11082) (赤髪の白雪姫
\[5/10\]), which made more sense when I remembered Shirayuki is something of an
apothecary, but again it’s very explicitly a _shoujo_ romance series, just with
a western fantasy rather than eastern historical setting. Just based on vibes,
if you’re accepting western fantasy settings, _Apothecary Diaries_ does feel a
bit similar to
[_Ascendance of a Bookworm_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm/)
(本好きの下剋上 ～司書になるためには手段を選んでいられません～ \[8/10\]), enough
for some to confuse the two (shoutout Hermea), but _Bookworm_ is even less
focused on romance.[^fn3] Anyway, the story still bangs, so I’ll give it a
tentative 7/10 thus far for the lower quality; I haven’t finished it because I
was busy going on a date with my wife, going outside, being confused about how
little fare is left on my transit card, buying books.

[_Ruri Dragon_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/rymwscf/ruri-dragon) (ルリド
ラゴン) is one of the books I bought, a supernatural modern slice-of-life manga
about a young girl named Ruri, who wakes up one day to find she has dragon
horns. I started reading it when it first started publishing on MANGA Plus,
because it’s a cute story about a girl being awkward about random changes in her
body. The series went on hiatus when the author fell ill for quite a while, but
it has since continued, though I haven’t kept up with it much because I randomly
uninstall MANGA Plus when I forget why I installed it in the first place.[^fn4]
It sort of reminds me of
[_Machikado Mazoku_](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/8t53mwi/machikado-mazoku)
(まちカドまぞく \[7/10\]) with the initial premise, but it doesn’t have the same
“GL subtext” as it were. Apparently, it’s up to the third volume in Japan now, I
should catch up on that, but I picked up the first volume at Kinokuniya while
there. I give it a solid 7/10 as far as I have read.

I did start reading
[_Fake Saint of the Year_](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/fake-saint-of-the-year/)
(理想の聖女？　残念、偽聖女でした！ ～クソオブザイヤーと呼ばれた悪役に転生したん
だが～) yesterday, since I was on the train and wanted to read an e-book so it
wouldn’t fail to load in tunnels. Officially translated gender-bender!? What!?
Just a shame that it isn’t yuri. I’m only a couple chapters in so I don’t have
much to say about it other than the fact that Japanese novels sure speedrun the
setup in their prologues. Also, is it better to say the protagonist definitely
worked really hard for a decade off screen to become powerful than just saying
they’re the coolest, hottest, strongest girl in the whole universe? Anyway, I’m
totally, actually, very much so going to write that thing about “thing” for next
week. I’ll bet this chocolate baumkuchen on it… oh, wait, I just finished eating
it.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:
    I skimmed the first volume a bit and Fine is in it a bit less than the anime
    but at least the frequency of Meg saying they should get married is true to
    source. Yen Press has only published the first volume in English so far
    though (that’s half the anime). The web novel on the other hand… hmm.

[^fn2]:
    It may seem arbitrary to use a Japanese term here, given that I could just
    say “reverse _isekai_” or “desekai” (I think either my wife or I coined this
    one, maybe we did see it somewhere first); however, I just want to point out
    that this sort of thing is pretty normal to consider an _isekai_ series in
    some communities.

[^fn3]:
    I believe the side story about Hannelore that I just never bothered to read
    is more of a romance than the main story (an absolute shame, I still ship
    her with Myne and you cannot stop me); Myne and Ferdinand are never
    romantically involved, they’re basically just friends having each other’s
    backs… \[SPOILERS\] they do get married, but that’s just political, since
    neither of them actually ever wants to get married.

[^fn4]:
    Obviously, it’s just there for _Ruri Dragon_ and _Spy x Family_, a while ago
    I also had it for _Ayakiashi Triangle_ but I left that one on hold and also
    I think it’s finished now?
