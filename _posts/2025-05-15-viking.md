Okay, so the last few articles in this series were, let’s say, difficult, as
evidenced by their sparse publication. To remedy this key issue, it is prudent
to designate for the next installment a word known to have a fun,
interesting, and most importantly _straightforward_ etymology. I’m kidding, of
course, I showed my wife my list of incomplete articles and from among them she
chose “viking,” so here’s something of a historiographical discussion on various
theories on the etymology thereof.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

Once again, contemporary sources provide us with some answers and a number of
further questions. Per
[Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Viking#etymonline_v_7786), ‘viking’
is a “historian’s revival,” that is a
[learned borrowing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/learned_borrowing),
introduced first to English as
[_vikingr_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/v%C3%ADkingr) by the historian
[Sharon Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Turner) in 1801.[^fn1]
Verifying this attestation has proven difficult, as on-line microfilm scans of
Turner’s
[_The History of the Anglo-Saxons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Anglo-Saxons),
in which the usage supposedly first appears, are limited to the first
volume.[^fn2] For some consolation, there do exist reviews from the time, such
as The Imperial Review, with heavy excerption, allowing some manner of
verification:[^fn3]

> “The sea-kings had the name of honour; but they were only a portion of those
> pirates or vikingr, who, in the ninth century, were covering the ocean. \[…\]
> The name by which these pirates were at first distinguished was vikingr,
> which, perhaps, originally meant kings of the bays.”

Here we see not only use of _vikingr_ but a baffling etymology as well. This
reads as though Turner believed that _-kingr_ is related to ‘king,’ perhaps
motivated to parallel other terms he had used, such as “sea-kings” or
“land-kings.” The ‘[-ing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ing#Old_English)’ in
‘[king](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/king#English)’ is remarkably similar to
Old Norse (ON)
[_-ingr_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ingr#Old_Norse) (“denoting an
inhabitant or original of a particular place, a student of a particular school,
etc.”[^fn4]) in that it marks a noun as related to its root (e.g. ‘clothing’
relates to ‘cloth’) yet has nothing to do with rule. The Old Norse for ‘king’
is, as it survives in Icelandic,
[_konungr_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/konungr#Old_Norse) or _kongr_.[^fn5]
This statement, interestingly, appears not only in the first edition, but in all
subsequent editions of the work as well.[^fn6]
{:.content__p_noindent}

In defense, Turner cites [Wormius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Worm)’
_Danicorum Monumentorum_ p. 269 and
[Bartholin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bartholin)’s _Antiquitatum
Danicarum_ p. 446, though only to support that “viig means bay.” It turns out,
both of these sources do support the idea that there is some link between bays
and vikings, take Bartholin for example:[^fn7]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> “_Denique communissime Piratæ à veteribus nominati Vikingar, quos dictos sic
> volunt a vik, quod Danis sinum maris notat, in iss enim delitescebant à
> tempestatum iniuriis tuti, vel hostibus insidias structuri._”

> “Finally, the most common pirates were the Vikings, named by the ancients, who
> were so called from vik, which the Danes call a bay of the sea, for in them
> they hid, safe from the harms of storms, or laid ambushes for their
> enemies.”[^fn8]

A really funny note about this quote, is that Wormius says the same thing word
for word from “_dictos sic…_” with the exception of _vik_ being written
_Viig_.[^fn9] Bartholin was something like a ward of Wormius, so this isn’t
surprising.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The form ‘[viking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Viking),’ returning to
Etymonline’s explanation, “is attested in 1820, in Jamieson's notes to ‘The
Bruce.’”[^fn10] This Jamieson being
[John Jamieson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jamieson) and “The Bruce”
being his edition of
[John Barbour](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barbour_(poet)>)’s
[_The Bruce_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brus)_._ The instances of the
term’s usage in said notes are exceptionally limited, but the context is
particularly exciting:[^fn11]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> _“**Viking**-fiord_ would signify, the sound, or firth, of the pirates or
> sea-kings, the place where they were wont to land. \[…\] Camden has observed
> that the Latin writers of the English history called the Danes in general
> _Wiccingi_, because they exercised piracy; as Anglo-Saxon _wiccing_ signifies
> a pirate. \[…\] It may be suspected that the Irish term _viginge,_ given by
> Obrien, as signifying ‘a fleet or navy,’ has been corrupted from the
> **_viking_** of the northern nations;”

This text is perhaps most notable for the implicit use of _viking_ as synonymous
with _vikingr_, but it is also notable that Jamieson included some discussion on
both Anglo-Saxon, that is Old English (ANG), and
Irish vocabulary (discussion of the latter of which falls too far out of the
scope of this article and thus further investigation shall be left to the
reader’s discretion[^fn12]). The relationship between _wiccing_ and _vikingr_ is
also mentioned in Etymonline’s entry instead as the
ANG
[_wicing_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wicing#Old_English) being a probable
derivation from ANG
[_wic_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wic#Old_English) (village/camp) since
“large temporary camps were a feature of the Viking raids.”[^fn13] The entry
also notes that the Anglo-Saxons of the time typically referred to the supposed
Vikings as _þa Deniscan_ (the Danes), this is similar to Wiktionary’s usage
notes on ANG
[_wīcing_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wicing#Old_English) which state the
more frequent descriptors as
[_Norþmenn_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nor%C3%BEmann#Old_English),
[_hǣþene_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/h%C3%A6%C3%BEen#Old_English), and
[_Dene_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Dene#Old_English).[^fn14] Regardless,
following these attestations, along with the antiquarian trends at the time, the
terms _vikingr_ and, more presciently, _viking_ were thus borrowed into modern
languages, so let us next tackle the other side of this exchange.
{:.content__p_noindent}

As previously mentioned, I’ll be taking a historiographical approach to the
Norse etymology of the term given its “contested” status. The outline for this
is primarily provided by [Eldar Heide](https://eldar-heide.net/)’s paper
“[_Viking —_ ‘rower shifting’? An etymological contribution](https://eldar-heide.net/onewebmedia/PDFer/Skipsartiklar/Heide%202005,%20V%C3%ADking%20%E2%80%93%20%E2%80%99rower%20shifting%E2%80%99%20An%20etymological%20contribution.pdf),”
which provides sources and refutations for a number of then and/or now popular
theories. It is perhaps necessary, before getting into theories on origin, to
define the word(s): ON _víkingr_ m. refers to a
sort of “sea warrior” and ON _víking_ f. a
“freebooting voyage,” the type a “Viking” would have gone on.

Let’s start with 1840, when
[Karl Richthofen](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Richthofen_(Rechtshistoriker)>)
published his _Altfriesisches Wörterbuch_ (Old Frisian Dictionary); the entry
for “(wiking), witsing, wising” provides both a refutation of the -king = king
notion as well as Richthofen’s own theory on the etymology:[^fn15]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> _“Das wort ist night aus wich-king (kriegs-könig), auch nicht aus wik-king
> (stadt-könig) oder wik-king (buchten-könig) zusammengesetzt \[…\]; denn könig
> heisst fries. kining, ags. kyning, isl. konungr oder kongr; sondern ing ist
> ableitung, und wiking, vom verb. wika (recedere), bezeichnet den welcher
> zurückweicht, enflieht, sobald er beute gemacht har;”_

> “The word is not composed of _wich-king_ (war-king), nor of _wik-king_
> (city-king) or _wik-king_ (bay-king) \[…\]; for king is called in
> OFS _kining_,
> ANG _kyning_,
> IS _konungr_ or _kongr_; but
> _ing_ is a derivative, and _wiking_, from the verb _wika_ (recede), means one
> who retreats, flees, as soon as he has made booty;”

While entirely concerned with Frisian, this theory of Old Frisian
(OFS) _wīka_ \> _wiking_ could be extended
backwards with Proto-West Germanic (GMW)
[_\*wīkwan_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-West_Germanic/w%C4%ABkwan)
\< Proto-Germanic (GEM)
[_\*wīkwaną_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/w%C4%ABkwan%C4%85)
(to yield, retreat) hence ON _víkja_ (to turn,
move) \> ON _víkingr_; or, as Heide interprets
it[^fn16] via Askeberg: ON _víka_ (withdraw,
leave)[^fn17] \> ON _víkingr_.
{:.content__p_noindent}

I will admit here that I have not read
[Fritz Askeberg](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Askeberg)’s _Norden och
Kontinenten i Gammal Tid_ (1944) as it is not available on-line and shipping
from Sweden is both expensive and slow,[^fn18] I will consider appending errata
regarding any further discussion on the work if/when I acquire a copy. That
being said, Heide presents Askeberg’s own etymology of _viking_ as such:
ON _vík(j)a_ (deviation, detour) \> _vík_ f. \>
_víking_ f. \> _víkingr_ m. where then a Viking would be “a person who makes a
detour from home.”[^fn19] Yet another, similar, theory comes from
[Host Haider Munske](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Haider_Munske), again
via Heide,[^fn20] which also originates from ON
_vík(j)a_ but in the sense of “to travel,” where a Viking would then be “a man
who makes a journey abroad.”[^fn21]
{:.content__p_noindent}

To return a bit to Richthofen, spinning off the notion of
“[wich](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/w%C4%ABg%C4%85#Descendants)-king,”
Falk and Torp’s 1903-06 etymological dictionary of Danish also briefly discusses
some possible connection with ON
[_vîg_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/v%C3%ADg#Old_Norse) (fight) before
ultimately settling that the origin is more likely with
ON _vig_ (bay).[^fn22] Of course, while Falk and
Torp presented the ‘fighter’ origin as rather popular notion (and, perhaps, it
was with their contemporaries), the ‘bay’ origin pops up with a much greater
frequency (as seen with Wormius, Bartholin, and Turner). A particularly
interesting example from 1852 can be found in
[P. A. Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Andreas_Munch)’s _Det Norske
Folks Historie:_[^fn23]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> _“Navnet 'Viking' var derimod forbeholdt Vesten. Her hed det, 'at fare i_
> _**Vesterviking**,'_ _og naar man hist og her finder den Talemaade slet og ret

This excerpt is of particular interest, similar to Richthofen, for the
alternatives it presents before reaching its conclusion. Here, Munch presents a
fairly reasonable argument for the theory that n. _víkingr_ is a demonym of
[Vik(en)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viken_(region)>),
ON _Vík(in)_ f., based on the origins of notable
Viking campaigns, though ultimately argues against it due to the existence of v.
_víking_. [Elof Hellquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elof_Hellquist)’s
_Svensk Etymologisk Ordbok_ also presents this theory, though without the
narrative introduction, and seemingly disputes it in favor of the ‘bay’ theory
per Heide; however, my understanding of Swedish is far too pedestrian to verify
this (even with the assistance of Google Translate), so I shall leave the
excerpt here for the reader to judge:[^fn24]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> _“I ags. redan i den mycket gamla dikten Widsið, alltså äldre än vikingatiden.
> Av omstridd o. trots alla tolkningsförsök ännu ej faställd härledning. Från
> ordbildningslärans synpunkt mest tilltalande av dessa äro antagandena av
> avledn. resp. till vik, alltså: som lägger till i vikarna, el. något därav
> bildat ortn (t. ex._ Vik, _nu_ Viken, _kring Kristianiafjorden), i så fall:
> man från Vik(en). Osannolik är däremot av flera skäl sammanställningen med
> germ._ \*wig-, _strida, i envig, vig osv., i vilket fall_ vīk- _utginge från
> ett_ \*wīgn-*.”*

The first two sentences are irrelevant to both ‘bay’ and _Vík(in)_ theories, but
they are interesting for reasons I’ll get into later (oh, this is turning out to
be a long one isn’t it?). Munch and Hellquist both mentioning the idea that one
might assume _vikingr_ is a demonym from _Vík(in)_ is most interesting when
considering that theory has seen some proponents in the time since.
[Staffan Hellberg](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffan_Hellberg), for
instance, compiled an extensive paper in 1980 analyzing sagas for this
connection among some other possible relations.[^fn25]
{:.content__p_noindent}

Further along, Finn Hødnebø supported the idea after a brief discussion and
refutation of the ‘bay,’ ‘recede,’ ‘detour,’ and yet unmentioned
ANG _wîc_[^fn26] origin theories in 1987,[^fn27]
conveniently also publishing the article in English.[^fn28] Hødnebø argues that
it’s an “irresponsibility” how easily others have rejected the notion, since
“there are no linguistic obstacles to the word formation _víkingr/wîcing_ either
in Norse or in the other Germanic Languages” and claims that “\[i\]t seems
likely that _Vík_ is a very old designation for Oslofjord and the sea and
surrounding coasts.”[^fn29] Heide refutes this theory for a number of reasons:
a) _Vík_ having a definite article, as in _Víkin_, points to it not being as old
as ANG _wīcing_; b) Old Norse _-ing_ was used for
composite names (e.g. _hvalnes_ \> _hvalnesingr_) and _-ungr_ for non-composites
(i.e. _Vík(in)_ \> _\*víkungar_); and c) “there is no reason to believe the
people from that area played a prominent role in the naval operations of that
time.”[^fn30] I’ll spare you any further narration of the discourse, anyone
interesting in the full tit-for-tat debates of any of these theories is
obviously welcome to read the original papers for themselves.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Finally, let’s discuss Eldar Heide’s own theory, which builds off of
[Bertil Daggfeldt](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertil_Daggfeldt)’s 1983
proposition that the word originates from Old Swedish
(OSV) _vika_ (turn/shift) as in the shifts of
oarsmen.[^fn31] By far the most interesting argument Heide makes is that the
feminine _víking_ couldn’t have been derived from the masculine _víkingr_ in Old
Norse, but that the opposite could’ve been the case.[^fn32] Thus, his
derivation, assuming that the term predates the sailing age and thus originates
from rowing, is as such: ON _víka_ (to shift) \>
_víking_ f. (shifting) \> _víkingr_ m. (one who shifts), meaning that Vikings
were originally “men rowing in shifts.”
{:.content__p_noindent}

Now for something completely different; I’d say this is the shirttail, but it
was the original point of the article before I got distracted by contested
etymologies. What I wish to narrate henceforth is far less contested a
development, so I shall opt to present it in a more straightforward manner.

Inspired by sagas about Ragnar Lodbrock, the historical fiction novelist
[Edison Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Marshall) published _The
Viking_ in 1951. This novel was then adapted in 1958 as the film
[_The Vikings_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vikings_(film)>) (directed by
[Richard Fleischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fleischer), screenplay
by [Calder Willingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Willingham)). The
plot is a far cry from anything in the sagas, as it centers on Einar
([Kirk Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas)), son of Ragnar
([Ernest Borgnine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine)), and his
half-brother Eric ([Tony Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Curtis)),
both of whom are original characters to the work. Having watched the movie, I
agree with many of the critiques that the story is rather lackluster given the
grandiosity of both the vikings and the more mythical aspects; at least it was
probably more exciting in the ‘50s, though the historical aspects are a bit…
anyway.
{:.content__p_noindent}

In 1957, Inumaru Tetsuzou
([犬丸徹三](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%8A%AC%E4%B8%B8%E5%BE%B9%E4%B8%89)),
President of the
[Imperial Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Hotel,_Tokyo)
([帝国ホテル](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B8%9D%E5%9B%BD%E3%83%9B%E3%83%86%E3%83%AB))
in Tokyo since 1945, took a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark\![^fn33] There he
discovered the [smörgåsbord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smorgasbord) (I
would’ve thought the Danish would call it
[_det kolde bord_](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Det_kolde_bord) or even
[_smørrebrød_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B8rrebr%C3%B8d)), with its
servings of cold fish, bread, cheese, and sometimes deserts, and was instantly
taken with it, pushing Murakami Nobuo
([村上信夫](<https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%91%E4%B8%8A%E4%BF%A1%E5%A4%AB_(%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%83%95)>))
to research the idea and bring it to Japan. The following year, on August 1,
1958, they opened a buffet-style restaurant in the Imperial Hotel, opting
against simply naming it スモーガスボード (_sumôgasubôdo_) and instead named it
after the previously mentioned film which was then in theaters: (Imperial)
“Viking” or バイキング (_baikingu_, “viking”). Japanese lacks the /v/ sound in
general; thus, while it may be sometimes represented in the language as \<ヴ\>,
i.e. ヴァイオリン (_baiorin,_ “violin”), the sound is usually replaced with /b/
such that ‘viking’ is written as ‘biking.’ As this may have been the first
all-you-can-eat restaurant established in Japan, combined with its extreme
popularity, the name “Viking” came to represent any buffet in Japan and its
language.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Tangentially, the etymology of _smörgåsbord_ itself is rather fun:
SV
[_smör_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sm%C3%B6r#Swedish) (butter) +
[_gås_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/g%C3%A5s#Swedish) (goose) \>
[_smörgås_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5s#Swedish) (open-face
sandwich) + [_bord_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bord#Swedish) (table) \>
[_smörgåsbord_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord#Swedish)
(cold buffet).
{:.content__p_noindent}

This ran a bit long for an article meant to just provide my friends with enough
historical context that I can point to a bicycle and say “一緒にバイキングしたい
か?” What didn’t I talk about this time? Worm and Bartholin more or less
established the study of the Norse, which had something to do with their
relationship with the
[Möðruvallabók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6%C3%B0ruvallab%C3%B3k).
Hødnebø mentioned [Sophus Bugge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Bugge), I
promptly ignored this, but the man had some truly insane theories on Norse
mythology and such, that may be interesting to read up on. John Jamieson
actually did a lot of work in etymology, that could be fun. I’m still
considering getting my hands on Askeberg and Munske’s works, especially the
latter. Oh, and Heide mentioned that ON v. _víka_ (turn aside) \> n. _vík_
(where the land turns aside), which is actually really cute at the end of all
this. The end… send me money so I can afford historiographically notable texts
on etymology or something.

    Heide argues in note 2 that the form _víka_ is the most common form, wheras
    _víkja_ is a secondary form and thus “etymologically less interesting.”

    Full disclosure, the book itself would cost \$16.13 with shipping being
    \$24.95 and taking between 25 to 45 _business days_. Which is, sadly, 
    outside my budget of $0 for this series.

    If anything, I am more likely to purchase a copy of Munske’s _Das Suffix
    \*-inga/unga in den germanischen Sprachen_ than Askeberg’s work, as it
    pertains to a more diverse range of linguistic topics and is not entirely
    unlikely to be relevant to future articles. Tangentially, at the time of
    writing this note, May 7, 2025 at 10:43am, Munske turned 90 two days ago,
    and he’s still alive! Congratulations!

    This historiography thing is burning me out, so I’m mostly going to skip
    going into detail on this theory. Basically, the argument comes down to
    whether the word was loaned to or from Old English, this theory of course
    siding with the latter. As mentioned earlier, _wîc_ means “village/camp” and
    therefore would imply something that likely wasn’t true about the Vikings
    themselves, much like any number of these theories. I believe Grønvik made
    the most clear article on this:
