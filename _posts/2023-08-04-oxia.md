title: Oxia Palus
---

Of the 30 quadrangles of Mars[^fn1] used in areography, the most interesting is
usually considered to be
[Oxia Palus (MC-11)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxia_Palus_quadrangle). This
interest is owed to evidence of water on the Martian surface, including
clay-rich sediment deposits,[^fn2] possible remnants of springs,[^fn3] and the
Ares Valles as an outflow channel.[^fn4] It also has some cultural relevance,
both with the landing site of the Mars Pathfinder[^fn5] and Mark Watney's
journey in [_The Martian_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)>)
passing through the area.[^fn6] My interest, while purely geomorphological in
nature at first, has now turned a tad etymological. After all, Oxia Palus is
quite the interesting name.
{:.dropcap}

The names of quadrangles are derived from classical names for albedo features on
the planet.[^fn7]
[A list of said features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_albedo_features_on_Mars#O-S)
claims the meaning is taken from [Oxeia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxeia)
(Οξεία), a Greek island of the
[Echinades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinades). This is doubtful as a
namesake, given that the island is uninhabited and owned entirely by
Qatar.[^fn8]

It's not even the most interesting island named Oxeia.
[Sivriada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivriada) is an island of the
Adalar[^fn9] archipelago and thus falls within the Municipality of Adalar,
İstanbul, Türkiye.[^fn10] Like all the islands of Adalar, Sivriada has a history
of imprisoning the unwanted, from the Saint[^fn11] Plato of Sakkoudion[^fn12] to
30,000 dogs in what has been dubbed the "Hayırsızada Dog Massacre."[^fn13] Note
that _oxeia_ means 'sharp,' in the sense of 'acute,' as in a typographic
accent[^fn14] or geometric angle.[^fn15] Derived from the Ancient Greek 'ὀξεῖα'
of the same meaning,[^fn16] whence 'ὀξύς' (sharp/pointed),[^fn17] Oxeia being a
name for Sivriada makes sense, as _sivri_ is a Turkish term for 'sharp.'[^fn18]
Interesting as this may be, it does not answer the question, these are all dead
ends.
{:.no-indent}

As usual, asking only the specifics is doomed to fail; thus, we shall broaden
the scope a bit. In 1958, an ad hoc committee of the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org/) (IAU) chaired by
[Adouion Dollfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audouin_Dollfus), similar to a
previous committee for the Moon,[^fn19] recommended the adoption of 128 names
for surface features on Mars,[^fn20] including Oxia Palus and Oxus.[^fn21] While
a number of nomenclatures existed for Mars through the 19<sup>th</sup>
century,[^fn22] the one that survived to lend itself to the names chosen for the
IAU[^fn23] stemmed from the work of
[Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli).

Schiaparelli began his study of Mars with its 1877 [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(astronomy));[^fn24] though
initially hesitant to do so at all,[^fn25] he mapped his observations with a
previously unattained level of fidelity.[^fn26] Eschewing
[Richard A. Proctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Proctor)'s
nomenclature for the mapped features,[^fn27] Schiaparelli here introduced his
own names drawn from classical and Biblical literature.[^fn28] Such a choice of
names was not without precedent, as
[Johannes Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius) had
utilized an equally esoteric scheme for lunar features in 1647.[^fn29] Neither
was he the first to observe the _canali_ on Mars,[^fn30] the term itself adopted
from [Angelo Secchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Secchi)'s
_canale_;[^fn31] he was merely the first to include such number of them in a map
as he did.[^fn32] While there is much to be said about the notion of the
_canali_, which were in English translated as 'canals' rather than the more
naturalistic 'channels,'[^fn33] let's exercise a modicum of restraint for the
moment and discuss only the naming thereof.
{:.no-indent}

To fully understand Schiaparelli's integration of classical names, we need not
only consider the names themselves, but their order as well: "the dividing line
on Mars reflects the day's journey of Helios from the East to the West."[^fn34]
That is to say that traversal of the Martian equator was to parallel such a trek
across the Old World, from the Far East, through the Levant and Egypt, to the
Underworld in the west. This remained true for the _canali_, named for rivers of
those lands, reflecting the same longitudinal order as Greek or Roman maps.
Indeed, in Schiaparelli's map of his observations during the 1879
opposition,[^fn35] we can find our enigmatic Oxus between the ancient
[Indus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River) and the Biblical
[Gihon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gihon).[^fn36]
{:.no-indent}

Oxus (Ὤξος) referred to a great river of Central Asia per geographers of
classical antiquity;[^fn37] the name is now considered to have referred to the
[Amu Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya).[^fn38] So named for the
city Āmul, itself since having bore the names Chardzhou (Çärjew) whence Persian
_čahârjuy_ ('four brooks'),[^fn39] Leninsk in honor of
[Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin), and now
[Türkemenabat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkmenabat) whence
_Türkmen_ + _ābād_ ('town of').[^fn40] The Amu demarcates the border of Karakum
with Kyzylkum;[^fn41] its rich deposits drawn from these deserts, while causing
frequent changes in its riverbed and thus difficult navigation,[^fn42] naturally
beget civilizations within its fertile valleys.[^fn43] So salient has the Oxus
been historically that to cross it into
[Transoxiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transoxiana), or _Mā Warā'
an-Nahr_,[^fn44] would be seen as a great achievement for military campaigns in
Central Asia.[^fn45] Nonetheless, our concerns are not with the banks but with
the terminus of the river.

It's undeniable that the Amu Darya flows into the
[Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea), but historically it has been
said that the Oxus flowed into the Caspian Sea.[^fn46] This, of course, lends
itself to some confusion over whether or not the Oxus truly refers to the Amu.
Regardless, there existed a classical term explicitly designating the sea into
which the Oxus flows: Oxia Palus[^fn47] (or Oxiānus Lacus).[^fn48]
{:.no-indent}

Oxia Palus as a Martian toponym is credited[^fn49] to
[Percival Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell) in 1894. A true
believer in the canals on Mars,[^fn50] Lowell set out to document them[^fn51] as
well as the oases[^fn52] into which they supposedly flowed.[^fn53] It was in
this process that he named Oxia Palus, an oasis at the end of the Oxus. Within
the first volume of the _Annals of the Lowell Observatory_, however, Oxia Palus
does not appear on the list of oases,[^fn54] but alongside the observations of
"spots in the dark regions."[^fn55] Still, within the indices for Lowell's map,
the 'oasis' Oxia Palus is indeed marked.[^fn56]

Lowell famously stated that "\[f\]or a brand-new thing no name is so good as one
whose meaning nobody knows, except one that has no meaning at all."[^fn57] Thus
one should know not to expect justification from the man regarding names. In
truth, in this case the best we get can be found in the third _Annals_:[^fn58]
{:.no-indent}

> "I marked a spot at the bottom of the Margaritifer Sinus, or Pearl-bearing
> Gulf, darker than the rest of the gulf and around. \[...\] Lying as it did in
> the depths of the 'Sea,' fancy saw in it the pearl after which the gulf, as if
> by some strange prescience, had been named. On the map in Volume I of the
> Annals it is called Oxia Palus by inadvertence; the Margarita[^fn59] it should
> have been baptized."

This retcon, obviously, did not manage to take hold. The oasis retained the name
Oxia Palus, which was then accepted by the IAU, and eponymous of the [United 
States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS)'s quadrangle covering 
the region.
{:.no-indent}

Lowell's adamant assertion in not only the existence of the canals,[^fn60] but
that they were of artificial origin,[^fn61] can be said to have been a great
detriment to the field of planetary science.[^fn62] His theories, however,
inspired a great amount of science fiction regarding the planet,[^fn63] and many
novels from the 20<sup>th</sup> century would use a "Lowell-Schiaparellian
pattern"[^fn64] for Mars with deserts and water-bearing canals.

Once again, there were a number of branching paths stemming from this topic that
I opted not to travel too far along: the Iconoclast, military conquest of
Transoxiana, various rivers identified as the Gihon, depictions of Martian
canals in science fiction, &c. Yet, I must trim the scope somewhere and, as the
impetus has been quenched, that somewhere is here.

    The Turkish name, Adalar, literally translates to "islands." The English
    name for the archipelago is
    [Princes' Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes%27_Islands) (Prens
    Adaları), which supposedly comes from the Byzantine Empire's usage of the
    islands for exiling nobles. Alternatively, they could be called Istanbul
    Islands (İstanbul Adaları) based on its adjacency to Istanbul, or Red
    Islands (Kızıl Adalar) based on the color of their soil. There's also the
    historic Greek name, predating the Byzantine name, of Demonisi (Δημόνησοι).

    Confusingly, the

    district...," which is not true. It's uninhabited, of course it isn't
    officially a neighborhood. Five of the larger islands of the archipelago,
    however, are neighborhoods.

    Given the time already invested in this article, I will be exercising
    self-control vis-à-vis the historiographical context surrounding the rivers'
    locations and relative positioning. I'm also, quite maturely, brushing aside
    the fact that the name is spelled 'Gehon' on Schiaparelli's maps.
    Furthermore, I shall be ignoring the reasons why, on later maps, it shows up
    as 'Gehon I;' this is despite already having a general grasp on the topic as
    well as a number of yet to be collated sources.
