Picture this: I’m curled up in bed, cuddling my blåhaj,[^fn1] just thinking
about the many ways to represent the vowel
[/i/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel) in English
[orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography).[^fn2] Suddenly, a
rather solicitous thought encroached on my blissful musings. Why is it called
‘oxygen?’ Hydrogen is so called for the formation of water, so there must be
some parallel, right? Unable to shake the hold such worries had taken on my
mind, I turned to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oxygen). “Ah,” I
thought, “of course[^fn3] it’s ‘ὀξύς’ again!” Alas, a side-note in a
[previous entry](https://anarchy.website/oxia) had returned before me to strike
once more. Curiosity fulfilled, I could return to my unsleeping snuggles and…
wait a second. Hold the fuck on. What does ‘nitrogen’ mean!?
{:.content__p_dropcap}

The answer to this isn’t _technically_ complicated. Sure, it was difficult to
develop the full story from the knowledge I had on hand while laying in bed, but
the etymology is fairly straightforward. You could find a single sentence
explaining the whole thing on
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitrogen):
{:.content__p_noindent}

> From French
> [_nitrogène_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitrog%C3%A8ne#French) (coined by
> [Jean-Antoine Chaptal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Chaptal)),
> corresponding to [_nitro-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitro-#English) +
> [_-gen_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-gen#English). See
> [_niter_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/niter#English).

It’s shocking that I didn’t think of ‘niter’ while trying to figure this out,
sure; however, if you’re anything like me, this sentence asks more questions
than it answers.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Contrary to what may be implied by the presentation of this coinage, Chaptal did
not derive the term ’nitrogene gas’ directly from an association with niter, but
from the existing terminology of nitric acid, nitrates, nitrites, &c.:[^fn4]

> “\[…\] Nothing more is necessary than to substitute to \[Azotic Gas\] a
> denomination which is derived from the general system of use: and I have
> presumed to propose that of Nitrogene Gas. In the first place, it is deduced
> from the exclusive and \[characteristic\] property of the gas, which forms the
> radical of the \[nitric\] acid.”[^fn5]

Which, of course, necessitates that the etymology of the prefix _nitro-_
predates this assertion. Any hopes of an easy explanation by way of Wiktionary
are quickly dashed as it lacks any meaningful etymological sections for
[nitric acid](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitric_acid),
[nitrate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitrate),[^fn6]
[nitrite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitrite), and there is only the
relevant Ancient Greek root of _nítron_
([νίτρον](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BD%CE%AF%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek))
given for [_nitro-_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitro-) itself.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Chaptal makes a point in his proposition that he is merely righting a wrong
within the contemporary nomenclature, of course, so perhaps the source of that
very nomenclature would elucidate the matter. That was my optimistic belief,
anyway.
{:.content__p_noindent}

[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier)
was a chemist of some renown who, along with
[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Bernard_Guyton_de_Morveau),
[Claude-Louis Berthollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude-Louis_Berthollet),
and
[Antoine François de Fourcroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Fran%C3%A7ois,_comte_de_Fourcroy),
submitted _Method of Chymical Nomenclature_ (_Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique_)
to the
[French Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences)
in April 1787.[^fn7] This seemed as good a place as any to further my
investigations as the foundation of the nomenclature. It is also the origin of
the name ‘azote’ (and ‘azotic gas’) which Chaptal sought to supplant:[^fn8]

> “The denomination of _phlogisticated air_ has been abandoned by the greater
> number of chymists; who thought that it expressed more than it ought, even a
> long time before it was known to express an error. \[…\] It was not possible
> by a single word to express the double property of forming the radical of a
> certain acid, and assisting in the production of an alkali \[…\] we thought it
> were the better way to derive the denomination from its other property \[…\]
> not to maintain the existence of animals, to be really non-vital; \[…\]
> therefore we have denominated it _azot_ from the Greek privative α and ζωή
> _life_.”[^fn9]

The “certain acid” here refers to nitrous acid, which clarifies that the name
‘nitrogen’ was deliberately eschewed at this point. More presciently, as is
later stated with its listing among examples for which they “had much less to do
in reducing their appellations to our systematical rules,”[^fn10] nitrous acid
had been so dubbed prior to this work. There are some remaining gains, however,
in that ‘nitric acid,’ ‘nitrate,’ and ‘nitrite’ _are_ coined herein.[^fn11]
‘Nitric acid’ is described as a more oxygen saturated form of nitrous acid;
‘nitrates’[^fn12] and ‘nitrites’[^fn13] then are salts formed by nitric and
nitrous acid respectively.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Curiously, Lavoisier et al. maintained _nitre_ as a synonym for the _nitrate of
potash_ (potassium nitrate) or saltpeter.[^fn14] This is so notable for the
origin of ‘niter’ being in the term _nitron_, which typically denoted soda ash.
Soda, as well as potash, were early subjects of
[Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy)’s electrolysis
experiments, leading him to isolate their bases as the metals which he gave
names derived from their origins rather than properties: ‘sodium’ and
‘potassium.’[^fn15]
{:.content__p_noindent}

To digress further, the chemical which was at the time of Lavoisier et al.
referred to as ‘nitrous acid’ is now known to us as ‘nitric acid,’ and what they
dubbed as ‘nitric acid’ is now ‘nitrogen dioxide.’[^fn16]
{:.content__p_noindent}

So, who came up with the name ‘nitrous acid,’ if anyone? The term evidently
spawned somewhere in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century, as alchemy transmogrified
into chemistry. Previously, the same chemical was termed either
[_aqua fortis_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aqua_fortis) (lit. ‘strong
water’) or [_spirit of nitre_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spirit_of_nitre).

In an attempt to locate the coinage, or at least earliest usages, of the term, I
turned to _A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles_ for some
direction. Its earliest example for ‘nitrous acid’ is
[Nehemiah Grew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah_Grew)’s _The Anatomy of
Plants_,[^fn17] The phrase does appear herein, though as a reactant with _spirit
of nitre,_[^fn18] which implies that Grew was simply describing an acid that is
[nitrous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitrous).
[John French](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_French_(physician)>), too,
described an acid in such a manner as early as the 1653 edition of _The Art of
Distillation_, narrating it as a source of nitrous salts.[^fn19]
{:.content__p_noindent}

Perhaps we ought to again try to move backward.
[William Lewis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_(scientist)>)’s
1746 _A Course of Practical Chemistry_ seemingly uses ‘nitrous acid’ as a name
for a chemical a handful of times.[^fn20] Usage by
[Richard Boulton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boulton) in 1714 appears
less specific, that is more often using ‘nitrous’ as an adjective, yet still
explicit enough to warrant note.[^fn21] The most explicit reference to the
phrase as a term itself I could find was from
[Gideon Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Harvey) in 1675:[^fn22]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> “Some use may be made of describing _Acids_ by names derived from the _Acids_
> in Minerals, whereunto the _Acids_ in the Body bear a proportion and
> resemblance, \[…\] In \[this\] manner other _Acids_ may be termed nitrous,
> aluminous, &c.”[^fn23]

It’s likely from all this that the exact phrase was never specifically coined,
and that its explicit usage was merely born of the language at the time. One
could further explore that the adjective ‘nitrous’ (meaning ‘pertaining to
nitre’) was itself a result of the change from Middle to Modern English in the
17<sup>th</sup> c., having previously been written ‘nitrose.’[^fn24] That, in
turn, brings us back to (Middle) French
[_nitreux_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nitreux#Middle_French), which
composed the term Lavoisier et al. were actually referencing:
[_acide nitreux_](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/acide_nitreux). As the
relevance of this section is already questionable, I’ll leave any further
discussion on that particular phrase as an exercise to the reader.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Speaking of French terminology, Chaptal’s _nitrogène_ failed to gain traction in
France[^fn25] where [_azote_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/azote#French)
remains the dominant term to this day. To lead establish a better foundation for
a point I’d like to get to in a bit, we ought to discuss how this French _azote_
and English ‘nitrogen’ proliferated throughout other languages.

Let’s start with Dutch, where nitrogen is called _stikstof_, whence _stikken_
(“to suffocate”) and _stof_ (“matter”). English Wiktionary is contradictory
about the etymology, claiming the Dutch
[_stikstof_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stikstof#Dutch) is borrowed from the
German [_Stickstoff_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Stickstoff#German), then
states that _Stickstoff_ was introduced by
[Christopher Girtanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Girtanner) in
1791, borrowing from _stikstof_ which was coined in 1789. Dutch Wiktionary
reaffirms the latter assertion;[^fn26] whereas German Wiktionary speaks nothing
to the former, only describing its origin as “chemischer _Stoff_, der Flammen
er*sticken* kann” (“chemical matter/substance that can suffocate/extinguish
flames”).[^fn27]
{:.content__p_noindent}

That the name supposedly originates from a property of extinguishing fire is
rather curious. The _Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen_ also describes
_Stickstoff_ as “den Feuer erstickenden Bestandtiel der Luft” (“the fire
extinguishing component of air”) while citing Girtanner in 1791.[^fn28] Dutch
Wiktionary goes so far as to describe the term as a translation of the French
_azote_,[^fn29] but you’ll again note that Lavoisier et al.’s reasoning for
their choice of term was that the gas is “non-vital,” which speaks nothing of
flame. Perhaps this mismatch can be reconciled by turning to Girtanner after
all:[^fn30]
{:.content__p_noindent}

> “Azote. \| Salpeterstoff od. Stickstoff”

Alright then. The modern term is clearly offered as an alternative here, with
_Salpeterstoff_ being the main coinage. Parallels can be drawn, then, between
_Salpeterstoff_ and _nitrogène_ as derivations upon saltpeter, as well as
_Stickstoff_ and _azote_ as statements on the non-vital functions of the gaseous
form. Regardless, no explicit reasonings were given by the author for these
translations.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Girtanner himself continued to prefer _Salpeterstoff_, using it exclusively in a
later book on chemistry,[^fn31] whereas a later dictionary lists the synonyms in
order of _Stickstoff_, _Azote,_ then _Salpeterstoff._[^fn32] As far as I am able
to determine, this change was simply a matter of popular taste lacking in any
major driving force as with ‘nitrogen’ over _azote_.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Back to the Dutch _stikstof._ This descended into Japanese through the typical
avenue of Rangaku. The scholar
[Udagawa Yôan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udagawa_Y%C5%8Dan)
([宇田川 榕菴](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%87%E7%94%B0%E5%B7%9D%E6%A6%95%E8%8F%B4))
offered three calques for different names of nitrogen in the _Appendix of
Far-Western Medical and Notable Things and Thoughts_[^fn33]
([遠西医方名物考補遺](https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/ya09/ya09_00857_0037/index.html),
_Ensei Ihô Meibutukô Hoi_), circa 1834:[^fn34]

1. ‘[窒素](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%AA%92%E7%B4%A0#Japanese)’
   (_tisso,_[^fn35] lit. “obstruction element”) for _stikstof_.
2. ‘[殺](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%AE%BA#Japanese)素’ (_sasso_, lit.
   “killing element”) for _levensberovendstof._
3. ‘[消](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B6%88#Japanese)素’ (_syôso_, lit.
   “extinguish element”) for _salpeterstof_.

The first of these is the extant term in Japanese. The second is odd, as the
term _levenberovendstof_ does not appear in any other material I have seen. And
the last feels most in line with the purported meaning of _stikstof_, yet bears
no relation to _salpeterstof_ which it was listed aside in the text.
{:.content__p_noindent}

_Tisso_ further descended via
[orthographic borrowing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#orthographic_borrowing)
into Korean as the term ‘질소’ (_jilso_), retaining the _hanja_ form of ‘窒素.’
The same process led to the dialectical Taiwanese term
‘[窒素](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%AA%92%E7%B4%A0#Chinese)’ (_zhìsù_);
however, the mainstream Chinese name for the element is
‘[氮](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B0%AE#Chinese)’ (_dàn_), a
phono-semantic compound of
‘[气](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B0%94#Chinese)’ (“gas”) and
‘[淡](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B7%A1#Chinese)’ (_dàn,_ “dilute”)
whence ‘淡氣’ (_dànqì_, nitrogen, lit. “dilluting gas”).
{:.content__p_noindent}

To wrap this all in a neat little bow, I would like to make some statements on
the nature of the language. See, the difference between “nitric acid” and
“saltpeter sour” is that the former is the vocabulary a conlang masquerading as
a dead language to borrow the prestige of a long dead empire while the latter
sounds silly to those of us indoctrinated by the culture developed by the same
Church as that very conlang. The Church being the origin of this “Neo-Latin” may
provide some insight into why some languages opted instead for linguistic
purism, as German and Dutch are notably Protestant culturally.

Alchemy begat chemistry amidst the Enlightenment, not as a rebirth but as the
first step in a transition. This was evolution, what must adapt will adapt while
that which needn’t adapt will not. New theories superseded old through empirical
dramas, yet the exclusivity of Neo-Latin was only shifted from the primary
language of treatises to that of jargon. Accessibility was brought to discourse,
but the specifics therein still harken back to the pretension of alchemy.
{:.content__p_noindent}

It isn’t anti-intellectual to demand science be discussed in laymen’s terms and
it isn’t xenophobic to adapt terminology to the language it is to be used
within. When you mock a language for its linguistic purism, say Dutch’s
_koolwaterstof_ for ‘hydrocarbons,’ you must ask yourself what benefit lies in
the alternative? What superiority is brought by the use of vocabulary learned
via rote memorization rather than intuitive etymologies? Just some food for
thought.
{:.content__p_noindent}

I’m calling it here. There’s room for further exploration into _acide nitreux_,
_Stickstof_ superseding _Salpeterstof_, who coined _stikstof_, and the origin of
‘淡氣*.’* I’ve also been purposefully tiptoeing around phlogiston theory, so if
you want an article on ‘oxygen’ you may offer tribute and I may consider it.
Hopefully, whichever word I choose next will be less taxing. _Tchüßi!_

    Also! Stop making fun of me for pronouncing it /blaʊhaɪ/! I get embarrassed
    trying to say it with the native pronunciation /bloːhaj/ and end up reading
    *blå* as German _blau_. Then I end up saying /blɑːhɑːʒ/ just to fit in

    Particularly, my thoughts were centered on how infrequently the letter ‘i’
    is read as /i/, with it being usually read as /ɪ/ or /aɪ/. As with many
    idiosyncrasies of English orthography, this is due to the
    [Great Vowel Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift). The
    exact transition into thinking about ‘oxygen’ was via the etymology of
    ‘[epoxy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epoxy)’ which does end in the vowel
    /i/ spelled as ‘y.’

    Tangentially, one of the instances of /i/ spelled as ’i’ that I could think
    of was the ‘[-ing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ing#English)’ suffix;
    however, this is apparently restricted to American dialects.

    Further tangent: every time I type ‘/i/,’ my computer corrects it to ‘/I/.’
    This is very annoying.

    “The most natural and suitable denominations which can be assigned to simple
    substances, must be deduced from a principle and characteristick property of
    the substance intended to be expressed. They may likewise be distinguished
    by words which do no present any precise idea to the mind. Most of the
    received names are established on this last principle, such as the names of
    Sulphur, Phosphorus, which do not convey and signification in our language,
    and produce in our minds determinate ideas only, because usage has applied
    them to known substances. These words, rendered sacred by use, ought to be
    preserved in a new nomenclature; and no change ought to be made, excepting
    when it is proposed to rectify vicious denominations. In this case the
    authors of the New Nomenclature have thought it proper to deduce the
    denomination from the principle characteristic of the substance. Thus, pure
    air might have been called Vital Air, Fire Air, or Oxigenous Gas; because it
    is the basis of acids, and the aliment of respiration and combustion. But it
    appears to me that this principle has been in a small degree departed from
    when the name of Azotick Gas was given to the atmospherical mephitis—1.
    Because none of the known gaseous substances excepting vital air being
    proper for respiration, the word Azote agrees with every one of them except
    one; and consequently this denomination is not founded upon an exclusive
    property, distinctive, and characteristick of the gas itself. 2. This
    denominations being once introduced, the nitrick acid ought to have been
    called Azotick Acid, and its combinations Azotates; because the acids are
    proposed to be denoted by the name which belongs to their radical. 3. If the
    denomination of Azotick Gas does not agree with the aëriform substance, the
    name of Azote agrees still less with the concrete and fixed substance; for
    in this state all the gases are essentially azotes. It appears to me
    therefore that the denomination of Azotick Gas is not established according
    to the principles which have been adopted; and that the names given to
    several substances of which this gas constitutes one of the elements, are
    equally removed from the principles of the Nomenclature. In order to correct
    the Nomenclature on this head, nothing more is necessary than to substitute
    to this word a denomination which is derived from the general system made of
    use: and I have presumed to propose that of Nitrogene Gas. In the first
    place, it is deduced from the exclusive and characteristick property of the
    gas, which forms the radical of the nitrick acid. By this means we shall
    preserve to the combinations of this substance the received denominations,
    such as those of the Nitrick Acid, Nitrates, Nitrites, &c. In this manner of
    the word, which is afforded by the principles, adopted and celebrated by
    authors of the nomenclature, causes every thing to return into the order
    proposed to be established.”

    “The denomination of _phlogisticated air_ has been abandoned by the greater
    number of chymists; who thought that it expressed more than it ought, even a
    long time before it was known to express an error. It is at present well
    known that this fluid, which makes so considerable a part of the
    atmospherical air, is not vitiated vital air; that it has nothing in common
    with respirable air but its state of elastic fluidity, which is caused by
    its union with caloric: in short, that in losing this state of gas it
    becomes and element proper to many combinations. As there are several proofs
    of its being a distinct substance, a particular name for it was necessary,
    and in searching for one we endeavored to avoid at the same time the
    inconvenience of one of those perfectly insignificant words which are not
    connected with any known idea, and which offer no hold to the memory, and
    the inconvenience perhaps the more considerable of prematurely affirming
    what has been only foreseen.

    It results from some synthetical experiments made by the Hon. Mr. Cavendish,
    and confirmed by a great number of analyses, that this principle is a
    component part of the nitrous acid. Mr. Bertholet has proved its existence
    in the volatile alkali, and in animal substances; it is probable that the
    fixed alkali also contains it, and from this it appears to deserve the
    appellation of _alkaligen_, as was proposed by Mr. de Fourcroy. But the
    analysis of these compositions is not sufficiently advanced to determine
    positively the manner of existence of this principle in those different
    substances, and from thence to attribute to it a constant and uniform
    property; besides, it was not possible by a single word to express the
    double property of forming the radical of a certain acid, and assisting in
    the production of an alkali; there did not appear any reasons for
    considering the latter of these properties in preference to the former, and
    by admitting the one in a manner to exclude the other. In this situation we
    thought it were the better way to derive the denomination from its other
    property, which it manifests in a very great degree, viz. not to maintain
    the existence of animals, to be really non-vital; in short to be so in a
    more considerable respect that the hepatic and acid gases, which do not like
    it constitute an essential part of the atmospherical mass, and therefore we
    have denominated it _azot_ from the Greek privative α and ζωή _life_. After
    this it may not appear difficult to remember that the air which we breathe
    is a composition of oxygen gas and azotic gas.”

    adopt the termination which, by common consent, has been applied to other
    newly discovered metals, and which, though originally Latin, is now
    naturalized in our language.

    Potasium and sodium are the names by which I have ventured to call the two
    new substances: and whatever changed of theory, with regard to the
    composition of bodies, may hereafter take place, these terms can scarcely
    express and error; for they may be considered as implying simply the metals

    “The variety of _Acids_ beyond this last inserted distinction, is great:
    _Acids_ are either Pontique or Styptique, as some deep red Wines, _Vitriol_,
    and many Vitriolate Præparations; Acerbous, as immature Pears, Apples,
    Plumbs, &c. Austere, as some sort of Wines, that taste sour and harsh. There
    is also an _Acre-Acidum_; a sharp _Acid_, without any Stypticity or
    Austerity, as the _Acid_ of Spirit of _Salt Marine_. In Mucilages is also a
    particular _Acid_ to be observed, which may be termed _Acidum
    Mucilaginosum_. Some use may be made of describing _Acids_ by names derived
    from the _Acids_ in Minerals, whereunto the _Acids_ in the Body bear a
    proportion and resemblance, as in some it’s remarkable, they experience a
    sour styptique tase upon their Tongues, not without some likeness to Copper,
    which may not improperly be called a _Nitriolat Acid_. In the same manner
    other _Acids_ may be termed nitrous, aluminous, &c. By the way I am to
    advertise, that I am not ignorant, that Natural Philosophers distinguish
    Tastes into acid, sharp, austere, &c. which here I do resume as kind of
    _Acids_; referring the truth thereof to the arbitrement of any ones sense;
    but those Naturalists following the umbrage of reason more than Notion,
    abstracted from _Experimental Philosophy_, no wonder they failed in this
    particular.”

    I was originally going to say it couldn’t compete in Lavoisier’s home turf,
    which would have been funny but not particularly correct. Primarily because
    Chaptal was also French, but also because (at least according to a
    [Dutch article](https://etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/stikstof) I read)
    Lavoisier himself preferred _nitrigène._ Regardless of the veracity of this,
    I consistently refer to the nomenclature’s authors as Lavoisier et al. as it
    was not just Lavoisier and may not have always reflected his personal
    opinion.
