      remainders of Yoruba infl in _Baha_ would account for the survival of
      this pronominal form (cp UNU _Bdos_), and _/-na/_ may have been added

    The term "Derived" here is used to refer to sets that are derived from 
    traditional pronouns. These could be considered canonical in that they are 
    created from the "standard" inventory, though their actual usage is 
    inconsistently implemented (and also cringe).

[^22]:
    What is the point of the slash when one could simply do "h'self"? 'Tis 
    truly a mystery.

[^23]:
    The term "Proposed" here is used for those sets that have been proposed as 
    gender neutral alternatives, but there is little implementation of them as 
    such.

    The list is taken from the [Wikipedia page on third-person pronouns][2], and
    as such may be incomplete. A more complete list of proposals throughout
    history can be found in [A Chronology of Gender-Neutral and Nonbinary
    Pronouns][13] from _What's Your Pronoun?: Beyond He and She_, or a similar
    but shorter list from the same author, Dennis Baron, "[The Epicene
    Pronouns: A Chronology of the Word That Failed][14]" ([alt][15])

    12-13.

    > **That Impersonal Pronoun.** &mdash; An impersonal pronoun, once in
      general use, would be such a great relief that few would care whether
      it were scientific or not. I prefer Nom. "e," poss. "es," obj.
      "em."[^33] First: In brevity it has been a clear advantage over any
      other I have seen offered. Secondly: "E" comes easily from "he,"
      nominative, singular; and "em" is a common shortening of the objective
      "them." I object to the proposed "thon." First: Because everyone has to
      be told how to pronounce it. Secondly: It is more than twice as long as
      "e," "es," "em." Thirdly: It is more difficult to speak, whether "th" be
      vocal or aspirate. Let us have the shortest and easiest. "Every writer
      has 'es' verbal likes and dislikes, yet, for the sake of convenience, I
      trust that even 'e' who dislikes verbal innovations will give my little
      word a little trial, and note for me the result." We may be sure that
      some such impersonal pronoun will eventually come. I say, "Let 'em'
      come."

    with the AMS-TeX Marcro Package_, 2 ed. (American Mathematical Society, 
    2004)[^34]: xv.

    > Since $\TeX$ is a rather revolutionary approach to typesetting, I
      decided that a rather revolutionary approach to
      $\text{non-S}_\text{E}\text{Xist}$[^35] terminology would be appropriate
      in this manual. I myself am completely unprejudiced, of course. As Mark
      Twain said, or should have said: All I care to know is that a man or
      woman is a human being&mdash;that is enough for me; he or she can't be
      any worse. But I hate having to say "he or she" or "his or her" or
      using awkward circumlocutions. Numerous approached to this problem have
      been suggested, but one strikes me as particularly simple and sensible.
      Just as 'I' is the first person singular pronoun, regardless of gender,
      so 'E' will be used in this book as the third person singular pronoun
      for both genders.[^36] Thus, 'E' is the singular of 'they'.
      Accordingly, 'Eir' (pronounced to rhyme with 'their') will be the
      possessive, and 'Em' (rhyming with 'them') will stand for either 'him'
      or 'her'.[^33]

    > The original code for the spivak gender was written by a programmer
      called Rog. [...] I asked him once how spivak came about, and somehow
      it came as no surprise that this unusual little identity was created as
      a snippet in order to test the system [...]

    > The short story is that, at some point back in '91 (hmm, has it really
      been 10 years? yikes...) when I was overhauling the `pronoun_sub` code -
      what's now `$gender_utils` was duplicated in about 10 different
      places and this offended me - I needed to test it out and so I created
      a bunch of extra, fake 'genders'. And when I was done, I left them in
      place, figuring that just having the usual male/female/neuter was
      boring, anyway. The Spivak set was something I half-remembered from a
      random textbook of his; though when I went back to check it, the only
      place I could actually find him using them was in the AMS-TeX Manual,
      which had a slightly different set from what I remembered (I distinctly
      recall him using 'hir' for the possessive, but the AMS-TeX book has
      'eir' so that's what it is, now...). And then, for some reason I can't
      quite fathom, the Spivak one caught on while the rest have been mostly
      ignored.

    > AS WOMEN HAVE grown freer, the English language has grown more tangled:
      What's a chairperson and who is a Ms.? But help may be on the way in
      the form of ey, eir, and em.

    > Those are the winning entries in the Chicago Association of Business
      Communication's contest to find pronouns to replace she and he [ey],
      him and her [em], his and hers [eir].

    > "It," a neuter pronoun, already exists, but contest winner Christine M.
      Elverson of Skokie says her words are "transgender pronouns." She
      formed them by dropping "the" from the familiar plural pronouns, they,
      them, and their.

    > FOR EXAMPLE, a speaker might use thess new transgender pronouns when ey
      addresses and audience of both men and women. Eir sentences would sound
      smoother since ey wouldn't clutter them with the old sexist pronouns.
      And if ey should trip up in the new usage, ey would only have emself to
      blame.

    > "There's a definite need for transgender pronouns," says Mrs.
      Elversion, editor of the employee newsletter of the G. D. Searle Co.

    > "It gets cumbersome when you don't know whether you're talking or
      writing about a man or a woman."

    > A contestant from California entered the word "uh" because "if it isn't
      a he or a she, it's uh, something else."

    > So much of eir humor.

    > That a new pronoun, of the singular number and common gender, is needed
      in the English language is a fact patent to every English speaker and
      writer. That the incorporation of this pronoun with the grammar of our
      common tongue and a general use of it in speaking and writing would be
      greatly facilitated by its formation from English word-elements and
      sounds which are already in common use, doubtless every English speaker
      and writer would unhesitatingly admit: And, as many of the most useful
      current words in the English language are abbreviations employed for
      despatch, it may safely be assumed, in touching upon this subject, that
      the further abbreviating of any English words, in such wise as to help
      language, in its perpetual race with thought, can but tend to its
      improvement, the first aim of language being to communicate our
      thoughts; the second to do it accurately; the this with despatch. The
      English word-makers and word-writers of out day are clearly
      practicalizing this assumption, and the philological atmosphere is full
      of winged words, the aim, in the making of which is to produce a
      minimum of word-body with a maximum of flying power.

    This section is for pronoun sets that have no specific proposals for usage 
    (as far as I know) but are still adopted by individuals for their own use. 
    The list is mostly taken from [Pronoun Island][1].

    Note that sources for the coining of "neopronouns" are generally difficult
    to track down, since they are very much independent and individual as
    opposed to published proposals for neutral pronouns. Often, there is no
    official "coining" per se and the pronouns are simply organically put
    into use. Also, I'm not digging thru thousands of Tumblr posts for
    this, fuck that noise.

[^32]:
    Per [nonbinary.wiki][8] the fae/faer set was likely coined circa 2014
    on Tumblr, though no specific and extant source is provided.
    NeoPronounsFAQ, however, [cites][10] another [post][9] by user Eidolan:

    > Using fae as a pronoun started out half a joke, a 1am offhand comment
      that fae would be one of the only things I could use as a pronoun and
      identify with. The next morning, it wasn’t so much a joke anymore, and
      by the end of the day my girlfriend and I had come up with how fae
      would work as a pronoun.

    > To address the point about fae as binary or not — it depends on your
      source material. My personal view on this is that fae and fae creatures
      as stand outside the binary. They probably have some form of gender,
      but it’s most definitely not our human binary. Angels, on the other
      hand, are genderless. They have no sex and they have no gender.
      Together, fae and angels are the two sides of androgyny that are
      possible, and kind of form a secondary arc around the male/female
      binary: that of gendered/genderless.[^40]

[^33]:
    Oddly, a lot of proposals seem to be missing independent possessive and
    reflexive pronouns, which have seemingly been either inferred or
    appended by other proposals since.

[^34]:
    Earliest edition I could readily get my hands on was a corrected
    version of the second edition. [As far as I know][5], the "Personal
    Pronoun Pronouncement" section and the usage of E/Em pronouns in the
    book go back to the original draft in 1982.

[^35]:
    Yes, the original contains a $\TeX$ pun. Yes, the formatting isn't
    entirely correct here, this document is not written entirely in
    $\LaTeX$ and is using MathJax to approximate the original (which is
    probably also why these logos are italicized, they should not be). But
    at least I managed to recreate it to some extent, get fucked [John
    Williams][12]. (No $\TeX$ joke has ever been funny)

    Literally a completely different word, but go off, I guess. At least

    > Because of the condition of things philological, do I venture upon my
      present suggestion of a certain lingual abbreviation and compound, to
      be known as this pronoun, believing that such a word would be more
      likely to come into general use than an entirely new one, as concerning
      it the memory is not taxed by any novelty of word-essence, but simply
      by that of its form, the ordinary meaning of the two words, which are
      abbreviated and blended so as to form this new pronoun, being carried
      into, and preserved in, this new pronoun, while a strain of the euphony
      of the two previously separate verbal entities familiarized the ear
      with the sound of the new word. This belief of mine was reached several
      years ago, after much digging among word-roots of various kinds, at
      home and abroad, my first attempt in this regard being to find some non-
      English word possessed of the proper significance, that would readily
      fall into line with our common speech. My failure in this attempt was
      complete. I then essayed numberless English word clippings, hoping to
      make the elision, or contraction, of some one English word to serve my
      purpose. This attempt likewise resulted in failure.[^42] Finally, by
      cutting off the last two letters of the English word _that_ and the
      last letter of the word _one_, and uniting their remaining letters in
      their original sequence in these two words, I produced the word now
      proposed for the needed pronoun&mdash;to wit,

    THON;
    {: .content__p_centered}

    > to the _th_ of which I would give the same sound as in _they_. This
      pronoun's three cases will naturally suggest themselves to its user as
      being the nominative, _thon_; possessive, _thons_; objective,
      _thon_.[^33] Note its literal and euphonic resemblance to the other
      pronouns, and that its final consonant has a neutral savor significant
      of its purport.

    > One thing I surely may be permitted to say in defence of the word, that
      it is simply an abbreviation, made in the spirit for the beautiful
      symmetry of the English tongue, and a due reverence for etymologic
      consistency; and that it is the expression of an honest attempt in the
      department of word-invention, which every user of our language, though
      writing never so little, is encouraged to enter by the numberless
      evidences, abounding throughout the entire range of its vocabulary,
      since its origin, of that inventive spirit under whose influence words
      may have shaped themselves more and more so as to equal in speed of
      utterance one's mental action. I could also urge the imperative need I
      have experienced as a lawyer, when making certain written or spoken
      statements, by reaching some part thereof where such a pronoun as this
      must appear, else I must recast the offending sentence on the spot, or
      plunge on defiantly through some common, yet hideous, solecism.

    > The acknowledgement of a need for such a pronoun as this being
      universal, any argument in advocacy of it clearly would be a work of
      supererogation; and, as illustrations of its use doubtless will present
      themselves for every reader of this letter, I will give but one or two
      myself: If Mr. and Mrs. A. were joint clients of mine in a suit at law,
      I might address a note thus: 'If Mr. or Mrs. A. comes to the courthouse
      on Monday next I will be there to meet _thon_.' Or, suppose, Mr. A. and
      Mrs. A. quarrel with each other and each comes to me, without the
      other's knowledge thereof, for advice in the premises, and I do the
      unprofessional act of effecting their mutual forgiveness and
      reconciliation; if I afterward undertake to describe to my wife the
      happy reunion of Mr. and Mrs. A. I may use this sentence: 'Then loving
      words for each other burst from their lips, each excusing the other and
      blaming&mdash;you cannot say himself or herself because one is a man
      and the other is a woman, but you can finish this sentence with the new
      pronoun&mdash;' _thon_.' Use of it will so individualize and
      pronominalize (so to speak) this word as to show its manifest
      grammatical distinction from the words that and one of which it is
      born; and the mental process by which it leads its user to the noun it
      represents will, I think, be found to be easy and natural, it not being
      an arbitrary sign.

    Erie, PA., July 23, 1884. C. C. Converse.
