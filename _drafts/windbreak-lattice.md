title: The Windbreak Forest Lattice in Hokkaido
---

Recently I've taken to spending a lot of time trawling across [Google Maps][1]
to seek out inspiration. This idea first came to me as something to be done when
building in [Cities: Skylines][2] as described by [YouTubers][3] such as
[Two Dollars Twenty][4] and [Pres][5], the former of whom specifically described
the practice in his [video on creating realistic cities][6]. I expanded on this
usage when, as inspired by [@Send_Lwyds][7]' [thread][8], I began work on a
[world map][9]. The issue with the methods described by many on this topic is
they take a wholly reductionist view on the formation of landmasses. This is
something that I was compelled to iterate on in a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    things that aren&#39;t erosion that significantly affect landmasses:<br>
    <br>
    1. plate tectonics<br>
    2. volcanic activity (see 1)<br>
    3. glaciers<br>
    4. asteroids<br>
    <br>
    thanks for listening to my ted talk (is this still hip)

The first point here was decently covered by [Artifexian][10] in his [video][11]
on creating fantasy maps, but I wanted something more in-depth. While working on
the [second part][12] of my blog series on worldbuilding, I became particularly
interested in [island arcs][13] which are a result of [plate tectonics][14] that
provide many neat landforms scattered across a world that would allow for a lot
of further worldbuilding. These form along [volcanic arcs][15] where volcanic
activity leads to the creation of [volcanic islands][16] in the form of a, you
guessed it, arc.

One such arc of islands
is the [Kuril Islands][17] (RU: Кури́льские острова́, JP: 千島列島 or クリル列島),
which are mostly in Russia (Росси́я) but parts are [claimed][18] by Japan (日本)
as part of the [Nemuro Subprefecture (根室振興局)][19] of the
[Hokkaido (北海道) Prefecture][20]. The exact subprefecture here is important as
it caught my eye when I was scrolling over the Kuril Islands, and by "it" here I
mean this odd sight:

**FIGURE 1.** A very large grid of trees in the Nemuro Subprefecture (根室振興局)
on Hokkaido (北海道).

<br>

I didn't give it much thought originally; at first glance it looks very similar
to something you might see in the United States of America (US) via satellite.
Of course, the US looks the way it does because of the [Public Land Survey
System (PLSS)][21], which is a uniquely American policy and not the only reason
one might find a grid formation on land. Once I'd recalled this, it made sense
to look further into what I'd seen.

<div class="pullquote left">
    "There is something to be said about the choice of a grid system for
    agriculture..."
</div>

Now, it wouldn't make sense to completely brush off the occurrence of the grid
here just because it isn't exactly the PLSS. There is
something to be said about the choice of a grid system for agriculture rather
than something like a [ribbon farm][22] system as seen in the New France parts
of the US for [some reason][23], but this isn't exactly informative with regards
to the exact formation seen here. So, I had to go on a little journey, mostly
through Wikipedia because usually you can find at least indicative information
there.

A good entry point, I figured, would be the township this is in. There are three
actually: [Shibetsu][28] ([標津町][29]), [Nakashibetsu][24] ([中標津町][25]), and
[Betsukai][26] ([別海町][27]). Taking a total shot in the dark I guessed door
number three (3) here, but the [English article][26] is all but useless so I had
to go with the very trustworthy method of having Google Translate translate the
[Japanese (日本語) article][27]. This didn't quite yield the results I'd hoped
for, there was an [image of the town from above][30] which I'd hoped would have
some comment about the grids, but it did not (now that I'm compiling everything
I'm noticing that the filename of this image is actually a pretty good
breadcrumb, more on where else it leads later).

Taking a bit of a leap of faith from there, I followed a link to one of the
agricultural coops (農業協同組合) in Betsukai: [道東あさひ農業協同組合][31]; I'm
not going to include the translated name here because I have high doubts that it
is accurate in the slightest. This was also fruitless, so I took a step further
out and went for the page on [dairy (酪農)][32], specifically the section on
[dairy in Japan (日本の酪農)][33]. In that was a subsection called "State-owned
KOSHEN pilot project" (国営根釧（こんせん）パイロット事業), which vaguely indicated
that this was a planned dairy farming project in Hokkaido, a sign of hope here.
There was a reference to [Rojikushima (根釧台地)][34], a page that contained the
phrase "根釧台地の格子状防風林は北海道遺産に認定されている," which was just
about what I was looking for. The translation was basically unintelligible but
still had significant phrases well enough that I could tell it was what I had
been looking for: [grid-like windbreak (格子状防風林)][35].

<div class="pullquote image">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Flag_of_Hokkaido_Prefecture.svg">
    <strong>FIGURE 2.</strong> Flag of Hokkaido Prefecture (北海道旗).
    <i>source:
        <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Hokkaido_Prefecture.svg">Wikimedia.</a>
    </i>
</div>

Of course, now it seems fucking obvious. Had I seen the filename on that aerial
photo I'd probably have seen the "shelterbelt" part and instantly found a whole
bunch of explanatory materials. To be fair, I hadn't really gotten any
sleep at the time, but I was right to draw comparisons to similar structures in
the US. There are [windbreaks][36] all over, named for the fact that they exist
to block out the absolutely terrifying winds you would get if you just had huge
empty fields. _However_, the windbreaks you find just anywhere are typically
only a tree or two wide, whereas the windbreaks in Hokkaido are, according to
[the prefecture's site][35], $180\text{m}$ wide.

Clearly, these are no normal shelterbelts, the [Hokkaido site][35] referred to
them as a heritage site even. I've seen them [mentioned][37] as a tourist spot
as well, which is an interesting occurrence admittedly, so perhaps the site for
the [Nakashibetsu Tourist Association (なかしべつ観光協会)][38] will have
something. If you notice an obvious tonal break here it's because I took a few
days off from writing this to move into my new apartment and I can't entirely
remember where I was going with that last sentence. In fact, let's just move on.

<div class="pullquote left">
    "That was a dead end, so I'm going to try to find another trail to follow."
</div>

That was a dead end, so I'm going to try to find another trail to follow. The
site for Nemuro Subprefecture has a section for historical sites including the
specific page "[根釧台地の格子状防風林][39]". Here there is some more information
that sort of implies a justification for the excessively wide windbreaks: that
there is not only wind but also snow and fog to be dealt with in Hokkaido. This
is also mentioned on [hokkaidolikers.com][40] (aptly named blog), where the part
about snow is also partly justified by pointing out it prevents snow from
building up in the fields, but does not distinguish how this would be different
from a typical windbreak stopping wind from doing just that. What's actually
interesting about this post is that it is the first resource I've come across so
far that includes history of the lattice beyond vague indications to the
"pioneering era" (開拓時代).

I'm not going to learn Japanese just to make a blog post... probably. With that
in mind, take everything I say from here with a heavy dose of salt; I'm at
worst directly reading an automated translation and at best doing that but with
the edges smoothed by interpreting said translation in context. Of course, I'm
only saying this now because I've found a source (in Japanese) that explains
just about everything I wanted to know. The source I speak of is the [Laboratory
of Forest Landscape Planning and Design (森林風致計画学研究室)][42] at the
[University of Tokyo (東京大学)][41]; specifically, a report from 2007 titled
["巨大な格子状防風林〜北海道中標津町〜"][43] by 秦 裕之, 横関 隆登, Xena Iannes
Lapido, and Roni Wijaya. I would *love* to commission a full translation of this
report (which I'm assuming was a project done by the authors during their
graduate studies), but a) I don't have any money and b) it is marked as
copyrighted so I'd have to contact the source to discuss that and
the language barrier there has likely already been made fairly clear.

Proceeding without any further consideration for the obvious issues. The
majority of this report is concerned with land use as it is from an agriculture
planning lab, the only section that I'm really interested in is [2.1 Development
Plan from the Meiji Era (明治期の開拓計画)][44].

Through careful searching of random combinations of characters around what I was
looking for, I eventually found out that what I'd previously referred to as the
"pioneering era" was actually a time after the [Meiji Restoration][45] when the
Meiji government created the Colonization Office ([開拓使][46]) in Hokkaido. The
term "pioneering" that machine translation produced here is fairly accurate as
the government recruited *[tondenhei][47]* ([屯田兵][48]), military settler
colonists, to settle the region. Knowing this clarifies a bit of the section I
had mentioned.
